  <h1>about iLogic</h1>

  <p style="margin-left: 24px";>iLogic is a free online interactive textbook
  for introductory college level logic courses. In addition to doing a small
  part to make higher education more affordable and accessible, the textbook is
  developed with the main goal of helping students improve their learning.</p>

  <p style="margin-left: 24px";>The Butte College Professional Advancement
  Project allowed me to devote more time to this project. It was completed and
  made available here in August 2008. Special thanks go to Kenneth Meier and
  Illeana Gantt for their encouragement, and to Ty Benoit and Jim Schmidt for
  the computer hardware and software used in this project. I would also like to
  thank my family for their understanding and support. My son Kevin&rsquo;s
  help in programming should be mentioned as well.</p>

  <p style="margin-left: 24px";>Revisions and updates were made in
  summer 2010.</p>

  <p style="margin-left: 24px";>Exercise 3.3 was made interactive without using
  Flash in summer 2011.</p>

  summer 2014:</p>

  <p style="margin: 6px 0 0 48px">Most Flash contents (except some in Exercise
