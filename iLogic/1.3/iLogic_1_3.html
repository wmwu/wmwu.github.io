<h2>1.3 Deduction and Induction</h2>

<p>Arguments are classified as deductive or inductive based on the inferential claim—the claim about how the premises support the conclusion. Deductive arguments claim to have conclusive support while inductive arguments do not.</p>

<h3 id="Deductive_Arguments">1.3.1 Deductive Arguments</h3>

<p>An argument is said to be deductive if its conclusion is claimed to <em>necessarily</em> follow from its premises. That is, if it is claimed that since the premises are true or acceptable, the conclusion must also be true or acceptable, then the argument is deductive. We can also define deduction by saying that in a deductive argument, the logical relation between the premises and the conclusion is claimed to be 100% supporting.</p>

<p>Notice that as long as the supporting relation between the premises and the conclusion <em>is claimed to</em> be a matter of logical necessity, the argument is treated as deductive. It is up to us to scrutinize carefully whether the conclusion <em>indeed</em> necessarily follows from the premises. The following are examples of deductive arguments:</p>

<p class="display" style="width: 63%;">Workers would lose job security if more jobs go overseas.</p>
<p class="display" style="margin: 6px 0 0 54px; padding: 0 0 4px 6px; width: 65%; box-shadow: 0 1px 0 0;">More jobs would go overseas if globalization continues.</p>
<div class="display2" style="margin-top: 6px;">

<p class="display" style="margin-top: 24px;">God does not exist in space-time.</p>
<p class="display" style="width: 63%;">If something does not exist in space-time, then it cannot have a shape or form.</p>
<p class="display" style="margin: 6px 0 0 54px; padding: 0 0 4px 6px; width: 65%; box-shadow: 0 1px 0 0;">Things without any shape or form cannot be either male or female.</p>
<div class="display2" style="margin-top: 6px;">
	<div style="display: inline-table; padding-right: 28px;">God cannot be either male or female.</div>
	<div class="label">1.3b</div>
</div>

<h3 id="Inductive_Arguments">1.3.2 Inductive Arguments</h3>

<p>Inductive arguments are more modest when it comes to the inferential claim. It claims only that its conclusion <em>probably</em> follows from its premises. That is, the inferential claim is that since the premises are true or acceptable, the conclusion is likely to be true or acceptable. Put differently, the logical relation between the premises and the conclusion is claimed to be less than 100% supporting.</p>

<p>As with deduction, the inferential claim in an inductive argument should be examined to see if the premises indeed makes the conclusion more likely to be true or acceptable. Here are some examples of induction:</p>

<p class="display" style="margin-top: 24px;">The windows are broken.</p>
<p class="display" style="width: 58%;">There are footprints with mud on the floor.</p>
<p class="display" style="margin: 6px 0 0 54px; padding: 0 0 4px 6px; width: 58%; box-shadow: 0 1px 0 0;">Some jewels and electronics are missing.</p>
<div class="display2" style="margin-top: 6px;">
	<div style="display: inline-table; padding-right: 28px; width: 80%;">Some intruders entered the house and burglarized it.</div>
	<div class="label">1.3c</div>
</div>

<p class="display" style="margin: 24px 0 0 54px; padding: 0 0 4px 6px; width: 60%; box-shadow: 0 1px 0 0;">It’s been observed that the farther galaxies are from the Earth, the faster they are moving away.</p>

	<div class="label">1.3d</div>
</div>

<p class="display" style="margin: 24px 0 0 54px; padding: 0 0 4px 6px; width: 63%; box-shadow: 0 1px 0 0;">Many people believe that crop circles are created by space aliens.</p>

	<div style="display: inline-table; padding-right: 28px; width: 80%;">Space aliens have visited the earth.</div>
	<div class="label">1.3e</div>
</div>

<h3 id="Validity_and_Soundness">1.3.3 Validity and Soundness</h3>

<p>Because the inferential claim in deduction differs from the inferential claim in induction, we use different concepts to assess how well the premises support the conclusion. For deductive arguments, we use the concept <strong>validity</strong>. Validity can be defined in three ways, even though they basically say the same thing:</p>

      <ol class="display">
        <li>A deductive argument is valid if its conclusion indeed necessarily follows from its premises.</li>
        <li>If the premises are true/acceptable, then the conclusion must also be true/acceptable.</li>
        <li>100% supporting</li>
      </ol>

<p>The third definition seems to be the simplest. A deductive argument is valid if its premises support its conclusion one hundred percent.</p>

<div class="bluebox">
  <div style="display: inline-table; padding-left: 24px;">Valid = 100% supporting</div>
</div>

<p class="above">It is important not to confuse the term “deductive” with “valid.” An argument is deductive when its conclusion <em>is claimed to</em> necessarily follows from the premises. After we critically examine the logical link between the premises and the conclusion, and find that the supporting relation is <em>indeed</em> airtight, then we say that the deductive argument is valid. This means that an argument can be deductive but invalid. That is, its conclusion <em>is claimed to</em> necessarily follows from the premises, but <em>as a matter of fact</em> the supporting relation is found to be short of 100% supporting.</p>

<p>Both of the argument (1.3a) and (1.3b) are valid. We will learn how to determine the validity of some deductive arguments in the next two chapters.</p>

<p>The second concept we use to evaluate deduction is <strong>soundness</strong>. For a deductive argument to be sound, it has to meet two conditions. First, it has to be valid. Second, each and every one of its premises has to be either true or acceptable.</p>

<div class="bluebox">
	<div style="display: inline-table; padding-left: 24px;">Sound = valid + true/acceptable premises</div>
</div>

<p class="above">Here is an example of sound argument:</p>

<p class="display" style="width: 40%;">Platypuses are mammals.</p>
<p class="display" style="margin: 6px 0 0 54px; padding: 0 0 4px 6px; width: 40%; box-shadow: 0 1px 0 0;">Platypuses lay eggs.</p>
<div class="display2" style="margin-top: 6px;">
	<div style="display: inline-table; padding-right: 28px;">Some mammals lay eggs.</div>
	<div class="label">1.3f</div>
</div>

<p class="above">The argument (1.3f) is sound because the logical connection between its premises and the conclusion is valid and both the premises are true. Given that arguments (1.3a) and (1.3b) are valid, they would also be sound arguments if all of their premises are true. For each argument, go over its premises one by one to see if each of them is true. If you agree that each and every one of its premises is true, then you would have to accept its conclusion.</p>

<div class="showSTTB">

<p>A sound argument is the most compelling reason one can come up with to convince others to agree with her belief or position. A sound argument is a proof. A logical person has to accept the conclusion of a sound argument as either true or acceptable. Refusing to accept the conclusion of a sound argument would be illogical, and thus unreasonable and irrational.</p>

<p>As long as a deductive argument fails to meet one of these two conditions, then it is unsound. So if a deductive argument is invalid, then it is unsound. The argument</p>

<p class="display" style="width: 60%;">If John F. Kennedy was assassinated, then he is dead.</p>
<p class="display" style="margin: 6px 0 0 54px; padding: 0 0 4px 6px; width: 60%; box-shadow: 0 1px 0 0;">John F. Kennedy is dead.</p>
<div class="display2" style="margin-top: 6px;">
	<div style="display: inline-table; padding-right: 28px;">John F. Kennedy was assassinated.</div>
	<div class="label">1.3g</div>
</div>

<p>is invalid despite all of its premises being true. The best way to recognize an invalid deductive argument is to identify its <strong>argument form</strong>. We will study how to do so in two deductive systems. Another way to see that (1.3g) is invalid is to compare it to the next argument:</p>

<p class="display" style="width: 65%;">If John F. Kennedy was killed in a plane crash, then he is dead.</p>
<p class="display" style="margin: 6px 0 0 54px; padding: 0 0 4px 6px; width: 65%; box-shadow: 0 1px 0 0;">John F. Kennedy is dead.</p>
<div class="display2" style="margin-top: 6px;">
	<div style="display: inline-table; padding-right: 28px;">John F. Kennedy was killed in a plane crash.</div>
	<div class="label">1.3h</div>
</div>

<p>We notice there is something wrong with (1.3h) because its two premises are true, but the conclusion is false. If it were valid, then according to the definition of soundness it would be sound. But it cannot be sound because its conclusion is false. This shows that (1.3h) cannot be valid. Since (1.3g) shares the same logical structure (form) with (1.3h), it is also invalid. An argument such as (1.3h) is called a <strong>counterexample</strong>. Using a counterexample is a clear and effective way of showing that any other argument with the same argument form is also invalid.</p>

<p>A deductive argument is also unsound if one or more of its premises are false/unacceptable. For example, the argument</p>

<p class="display" style="width: 55%;">All Republicans are social conservatives.</p>
<p class="display" style="margin: 6px 0 0 54px; padding: 0 0 4px 6px; width: 58%; box-shadow: 0 1px 0 0;">All social conservatives are against gay-marriage.</p>
<div class="display2" style="margin-top: 6px;">
	<div style="display: inline-table; padding-right: 28px;">All Republicans are against gay-marriage.</div>
	<div class="label">1.3i</div>
</div>

<p>is a valid categorical syllogism (we will learn how to determine the validity of categorical syllogisms in Chapter 2). But it is unsound because its first premise is not true.</p>

<p>If a deductive argument has false premises and a false conclusion, people tend to think that it must be invalid. But this is incorrect. Whether a deductive argument is valid or not is determined by its argument form, and not by whether its sentences are true or acceptable. Compare (1.3i) with (1.3j).</p>

<p class="display" style="width: 55%;">All Democrats are conservatives.</p>
<p class="display" style="margin: 6px 0 0 54px; padding: 0 0 4px 6px; width: 58%; box-shadow: 0 1px 0 0;">All conservatives are against stem cell researches.</p>
<div class="display2" style="margin-top: 6px;">
	<div style="display: inline-table; padding-right: 28px;">All Democrats are against stem cell researches.</div>
	<div class="label">1.3j</div>
</div>

<p>Notice that the premises and the conclusion of (1.3j) are false; yet it is valid because it has the same argument form as (1.3i).</p>

<h3 id="Strength_and_Reliability">1.3.4 Strength and Reliability</h3>

<p>Recall that the inferential claim in inductive arguments is more modest. It claims only that its premises make its conclusion more likely to be true/acceptable. The degree of support its premises lend on its conclusion is call the <strong>strength</strong>. It can also be defined in three ways:</p>

<ol class="display">
  <li>An inductive argument is strong if its conclusion indeed probably follows from its premises.</li>
  <li>If the premises are true/acceptable, then the conclusion is likely to be true/acceptable.</li>
  <li>more than 50% supporting</li>
</ol>

<p>When an argument <em>is claimed to</em> be less than 100% supporting, then it is inductive. If the supporting relation is <em>in fact</em> greater than 50%, then it is strong. Otherwise it is weak.</p>

<div class="bluebox">
	<div style="display: inline-table; padding-left: 24px;">Strong = greater than 50% supporting</div>
</div>

<p>Here is a simple example of strong induction.</p>

<p class="display" style="margin: 24px 0 0 54px; padding: 0 0 4px 6px; width: 46%; box-shadow: 0 1px 0 0;">All the ravens observed so far are black.</p>
<div class="display2" style="margin-top: 6px;">
	<div style="display: inline-table; padding-right: 28px; width: 60%;">The next raven you see will be black.</div>
	<div class="label">1.3k</div>
</div>

<p class="above">Since the premise of (1.3k) is true, the argument is said to be <strong>reliable</strong>. A reliable argument is a strong inductive argument with true/acceptable premises.</p>

<div class="bluebox">
	<div style="display: inline-table; padding-left: 24px;">Reliable = strong + true/acceptable premises</div>
</div>

<p>If an inductive argument fails to meet one of these two conditions, then it is unreliable. The argument (1.3e) we saw early on is unreliable because it is weak. So is the next example.</p>

<p class="display" style="margin: 24px 0 0 54px; padding: 0 0 4px 6px; width: 65%; box-shadow: 0 1px 0 0;">Preliminary studies show that patients treated with Xanafin recover without serious side effects.</p>
<div class="display2" style="margin-top: 6px;">
	<div style="display: inline-table; padding-right: 28px; width: 60%;">The new drug Xanafin is safe and effective.</div>
	<div class="label">1.3l</div>
</div>

<p>A strong argument may nevertheless be unreliable if it has one or more false/unacceptable premises. The next argument is strong but unreliable because its premise is false.</p>

<p class="display" style="margin: 24px 0 0 54px; padding: 0 0 4px 6px; width: 46%; box-shadow: 0 1px 0 0;">Most swans observed so far are black.</p>
<div class="display2" style="margin-top: 6px;">
	<div style="display: inline-table; padding-right: 28px; width: 60%;">The next swan you see will be black.</div>
	<div class="label">1.3m</div>
</div>

<p>Inductive reasoning by its very own nature can never give us one hundred percent certainty. However, one cannot dismiss inductive reasoning simply because of its lack of absolute certainty. It would still be illogical and irrational to reject the conclusion of a reliable argument. Even in our criminal justice system, the best we can demand is the benchmark of &ldquo;beyond reasonable doubt.&rdquo; By the same token, it would be unreasonable to refuse to accept a well-confirmed scientific theory by insisting on the lack of absolute certainty.</p>

<p class="above">The chart below shows how arguments are classified based on the concepts introduced so far:</p>

    <div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; width: 100%; padding-top: 81.16%;margin: 48px 0 24px 36px;">

<h3 id="Proof_vs_Confirmation">1.3.5 Proof vs. Confirmation</h3>

<p>The purported controversy surrounding whether the theory of evolution is “just a theory” was whipped up by exploiting the failure to distinguish deductive proofs from inductive confirmations. The charge that there is no proof for the theory of evolution plays on the word “proof”. If by &ldquo;proof&rdquo; one means deductive proof, then the charge is misplaced, for we ought not to insist on deductive proof for scientific theories. The deductive proofs that we are most familiar with are derivations of mathematic theorems from axioms or postulates. In contrast, scientific theories are accepted as true when they are well confirmed by evidence. Since such a confirmation is inductive, and not deductive, it would be unreasonable to demand a deductive proof for a scientific theory. The insistence on a deductive proof for the theory of evolution and the refusal to accept it unless it has been proven amount to a demand for certainty, and thus reflect a lack of understanding of how science works. Carlo Rovelli, a theoretical physicist, has stated very clearly on whether scientific theories can be proven:</p>

  <blockquote>Science is not about certainty. Science is about finding the most reliable way of thinking at the present level of knowledge. Science is extremely reliable; it’s not certain. In fact, not only is it not certain, but it’s the lack of certainty that grounds it. Scientific ideas are credible not because they are sure but because they’re the ones that have survived all the possible past critiques, and they’re the most credible because they were put on the table for everybody’s criticism.</blockquote>

  <blockquote style="margin-top: 12px;">The very expression “scientifically proven” is a contradiction in terms. There’s nothing that is scientifically proven. The core of science is the deep awareness that we have wrong ideas, we have prejudices. We have ingrained prejudices. In our conceptual structure for grasping reality, there might be something not appropriate, something we may have to revise to understand better. So at any moment we have a vision of reality that is effective, it’s good, it’s the best we have found so far. It’s the most credible we have found so far; it’s mostly correct.</blockquote>

  <blockquote style="margin-top: 12px;">But, at the same time, it’s not taken as certain, and any element of it is <em>a priori</em> open for revision...<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup></blockquote>

<p>If by &ldquo;proof&rdquo; one means evidence, then it is obviously false that there is no evidence for the theory of evolution. On the contrary, the theory of evolution has been one of the best-confirmed theories in the history of science. It has been accepted as one of our best scientific theories given the wide scope of evidence that confirms and supports it.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>The issue of the evolution theory touches many people’s nerves because they perceive it as part of the clash between science and religion. What is said here in this section is not meant to be the final words on such a big topic, but only serves to clear up the confusion caused by the word “proof”. On the topic of science vs. religion, Rovelli points out that a deeper clash, which goes beyond any conflict between a scientific theory and a religious belief, lies in the difference between scientific thinking and religious thinking:</p>
  <blockquote style="margin-bottom: 12px;">The question is, Why can’t we live happily together and why can’t people pray to their gods and study the universe without this continual clash? This continual clash is a little unavoidable, for the opposite reason from the one often presented. It’s unavoidable not because science pretends to know the answers. It’s the other way around, because scientific thinking is a constant reminder to us that we don’t know the answers. In religious thinking, this is often unacceptable. What’s unacceptable is not a scientist who says, “I know...” but a scientist who says, “I don’t know, and how could you know?” Many religions, or some religions, or some ways of being religious, are based on the idea that there should be a truth that one can hold onto and not question. This way of thinking is naturally disturbed by a way of thinking based on continual revision, not just of theories but of the core ground of the way in which we think.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">3</a></sup></blockquote>

      <ol class="ex_q">
        <li>The lights were all out and the car was gone, so we conclude that nobody was home.</li>
        <li>Since many people believe that there are other life forms in the universe, extraterrestrial beings must have visited the earth.</li>
        <li>Women office workers work just as hard as men office workers, and are just as productive. Women office workers should receive the same pay as men in comparable positions.</li>
        <li>Marijuana should not be legalized because it is potentially dangerous and not enough is known about its long-term effects.</li>
        <li>Thinking is taken as the main function of the human mind. So if computers can think, that would strongly suggest that the human mind is a material thing.</li>
        <li>Most Toyota cars are very reliable, so the Toyota you just bought will be reliable too.</li>
        <li>If we had state sponsored religion, then religious freedom would be threatened. To make sure we do not have state sponsored religion, we need to uphold the separation of church and state. This means that religious freedom requires the separation of church and state.</li>
        <li>Given that there are billions of galaxies in the universe and billions stars in each galaxy, there must be other life forms beyond the earth.</li>
        <li>Many people believe that near death experiences are evidence for life after death. Since there are so many reports about the near death experience. There must be life after death.</li>
        <li>To be a sentient being one needs to exist in time. This means that if consciousness and memory are retained in the afterlife, then the afterlife cannot be a timeless existence.</li>
