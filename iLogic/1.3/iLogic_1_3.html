<h2>1.3 Deduction and Induction</h2>

<p>Arguments are classified as deductive or inductive based on the inferential
claim—the claim about how the premises support the conclusion. Deductive
arguments claim to have conclusive support while inductive arguments do not.</p>

<h3 id="Deductive_Arguments">1.3.1 Deductive Arguments</h3>

<p>An argument is said to be deductive if its conclusion is claimed to
<em>necessarily</em> follow from its premises. That is, if it is claimed that
since the premises are true or acceptable, the conclusion must also be true or
acceptable, then the argument is deductive. We can also define deduction by
saying that in a deductive argument, the logical relation between the premises
and the conclusion is claimed to be 100% supporting.</p>

<p>Notice that as long as the supporting relation between the premises and the
conclusion <em>is claimed to</em> be a matter of logical necessity, the
argument is treated as deductive. It is up to us to scrutinize carefully
whether the conclusion <em>indeed</em> necessarily follows from the premises.
The following are examples of deductive arguments:</p>

            <td width="480px">Workers would lose job security if more jobs go

<h3 id="Inductive_Arguments">1.3.2 Inductive Arguments</h3>

<p>Inductive arguments are more modest when it comes to the inferential claim.
It claims only that its conclusion <em>probably</em> follows from its premises.
That is, the inferential claim is that since the premises are true or
acceptable, the conclusion is likely to be true or acceptable. Put differently,
the logical relation between the premises and the conclusion is claimed to be
less than 100% supporting.</p>

<p>As with deduction, the inferential claim in an inductive argument should be
examined to see if the premises indeed makes the conclusion more likely to be
true or acceptable. Here are some examples of induction:</p>

            <td width="420px">The windows are broken.</td>

            <td width="80px">&nbsp;</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>

<h3 id="Validity_and_Soundness">1.3.3 Validity and Soundness</h3>

<p>Because the inferential claim in deduction differs from the inferential
claim in induction, we use different concepts to assess how well the premises
support the conclusion. For deductive arguments, we use the concept
<strong>validity</strong>. Validity can be defined in three ways, even though
they basically say the same thing:</p>

      <ol class="display">
        <li>A deductive argument is valid if its conclusion indeed
          necessarily follows from its premises.</li>
        <li>If the premises are true/acceptable, then the conclusion
          must also be true/acceptable.</li>
        <li>100% supporting</li>
      </ol>

      <p>The third definition seems to be the simplest. A deductive argument is
      valid if its premises support its conclusion one hundred percent.</p>

      <table class="bluebox" style="page-break-inside: avoid;">
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td width="480px" style="padding: 12px">Valid = 100% supporting</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

<p class="above">It is important not to confuse the term “deductive” with
“valid.” An argument is deductive when its conclusion <em>is claimed to</em>
necessarily follows from the premises. After we critically examine the logical
link between the premises and the conclusion, and find that the supporting
relation is <em>indeed</em> airtight, then we say that the deductive argument
is valid. This means that an argument can be deductive but invalid. That is,
its conclusion <em>is claimed to</em> necessarily follows from the premises,
but <em>as a matter of fact</em> the supporting relation is found to be short
of 100% supporting.</p>

<p>Both of the argument (1.3a) and (1.3b) are valid. We will learn how to
determine the validity of some deductive arguments in the next two chapters.</p>

<p>The second concept we use to evaluate deduction is
<strong>soundness</strong>. For a deductive argument to be sound, it has to
meet two conditions. First, it has to be valid. Second, each and every one of
its premises has to be either true or acceptable.</p>

      <table class="bluebox" style="page-break-inside: avoid;">
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td width="480px" style="padding: 12px">Sound = valid +
              true/acceptable premises</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <p class="above">Here is an example of sound argument:</p>

      <table class="box">
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td width="280px">Platypuses are mammals.</td>
            <td width="240px">
            <td width="80px"></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td style="border-bottom: 1px solid #0a2c02;">Platypuses lay
            eggs.</td>
            <td>&nbsp;</td>
            <td>&nbsp;</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Some mammals lay eggs.</td>
            <td>&nbsp;</td>
            <td><span class="label">1.3f</span></td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

<p class="above">The argument (1.3f) is sound because the logical connection
between its premises and the conclusion is valid and both the premises are
true. Given that arguments (1.3a) and (1.3b) are valid, they would also be
sound arguments if all of their premises are true. For each argument, go over
its premises one by one to see if each of them is true. If you agree that each
and every one of its premises is true, then you would have to accept its
conclusion.</p>

<p>A sound argument is the most compelling reason one can come up with to
convince others to agree with her belief or position. A sound argument is a
proof. A logical person has to accept the conclusion of a sound argument as
either true or acceptable. Refusing to accept the conclusion of a sound
argument would be illogical, and thus unreasonable and irrational.</p>

<p>As long as a deductive argument fails to meet one of these two conditions,
then it is unsound. So if a deductive argument is invalid, then it is unsound.
The argument</p>

      <table class="box">
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td width="420px">If John F. Kennedy was assassinated,
              then he is dead.</td>
            <td width="100px"></td>
            <td width="80px"></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>

          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

<p>is invalid despite all of its premises being true. The best way to recognize
an invalid deductive argument is to identify its <strong>argument
form</strong>. We will study how to do so in two deductive systems. Another way
to see that (1.3g) is invalid is to compare it to the next argument:</p>

      <table class="box">
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td width="510px">If John F. Kennedy was killed in a
              plane crash, then he is dead.</td>
            <td width="10px">&nbsp;</td>
            <td width="80px">&nbsp;</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td style="border-bottom: 1px solid #0a2c02;">John F. Kennedy is
            dead.</td>
            <td>&nbsp;</td>
            <td>&nbsp;</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td class="noline">John F. Kennedy was killed in a plane
              crash.</td>
            <td>&nbsp;</td>
            <td><span class="label">1.3h</span></td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

<p>We notice there is something wrong with (1.3h) because its two premises are
true, but the conclusion is false. If it were valid, then according to the
definition of soundness it would be sound. But it cannot be sound because its
conclusion is false. This shows that (1.3h) cannot be valid. Since (1.3g)
shares the same logical structure (form) with (1.3h), it is also invalid. An
argument such as (1.3h) is called a <strong>counterexample</strong>. Using a
counterexample is a clear and effective way of showing that any other argument
with the same argument form is also invalid.</p>

<p>A deductive argument is also unsound if one or more of its premises are
false/unacceptable. For example, the argument</p>

      <table class="box">
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td width="420px">All Republicans are social
              conservatives.</td>
            <td width="100px">&nbsp;</td>
            <td width="80px">&nbsp;</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td style="border-bottom: 1px solid #0a2c02;">All social
            conservatives are against gay-marriage.</td>
            <td>&nbsp;</td>
            <td>&nbsp;</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>All Republicans are against gay-marriage.</td>
            <td>&nbsp;</td>
            <td><span class="label">1.3i</span></td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

<p>is a valid categorical syllogism (we will learn how to determine the
validity of categorical syllogisms in Chapter 2). But it is unsound because its
first premise is not true.</p>

<p>If a deductive argument has false premises and a false conclusion, people
tend to think that it must be invalid. But this is incorrect. Whether a
deductive argument is valid or not is determined by its argument form, and not
by whether its sentences are true or acceptable. Compare (1.3i) with (1.3j).</p>

      <table class="box">
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td width="420px">All Democrats are conservatives.</td>
            <td width="100px">&nbsp;</td>
            <td width="80px">&nbsp;</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td style="border-bottom: 1px solid #0a2c02;">All conservatives are
              against stem cell researches.</td>
            <td>&nbsp;</td>
            <td>&nbsp;</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>All Democrats are against stem cell researches.</td>
            <td>&nbsp;</td>
            <td><span class="label">1.3j</span></td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

<p>Notice that the premises and the conclusion of (1.3j) are false; yet it is
valid because it has the same argument form as (1.3i).</p>

<div class="second-half">
<h3 id="Strength_and_Reliability">1.3.4 Strength and Reliability</h3>

<p>Recall that the inferential claim in inductive arguments is more modest. It
claims only that its premises make its conclusion more likely to be
true/acceptable. The degree of support its premises lend on its conclusion is
call the <strong>strength</strong>. It can also be defined in three ways:</p>
<ol class="display"> <li>An inductive argument is strong if its conclusion
indeed probably follows from its premises.</li> <li>If the premises are
true/acceptable, then the conclusion is likely to be true/acceptable.</li>
<li>more than 50% supporting</li> </ol>

<p>When an argument <em>is claimed to</em> be less than 100% supporting, then
it is inductive. If the supporting relation is <em>in fact</em> greater than
50%, then it is strong. Otherwise it is weak.</p>

      <table class="bluebox" style="page-break-inside: avoid;">
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td width="480px" style="padding: 12px">Strong = greater than 50%
              supporting</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <p>Here is a simple example of strong induction.</p>

      <table class="box">
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td width="330px" style="border-bottom: 1px solid #0a2c02;">All the
            ravens observed so far are black.</td>
            <td width="190px">&nbsp;</td>
            <td width="80px">&nbsp;</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>The next raven you see will be black.</td>
            <td>&nbsp;</td>
            <td><span class="label">1.3k</span></td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

<p class="above">Since the premise of (1.3k) is true, the argument is said to
be <strong>reliable</strong>. A reliable argument is a strong inductive
argument with true/acceptable premises.</p>

      <table class="bluebox" style="page-break-inside: avoid;">
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td width="480px" style="padding: 12px">Reliable = strong +
            true/acceptable premises </td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

<p>If an inductive argument fails to meet one of these two conditions, then it
is unreliable. The argument (1.3e) we saw early on is unreliable because it is
weak. So is the next example.</p>

its premise is false.</p>

<p>Inductive reasoning by its very own nature can never give us one hundred
percent certainty. However, one cannot dismiss inductive reasoning simply
because of its lack of absolute certainty. It would still be illogical and
irrational to reject the conclusion of a reliable argument. Even in our
criminal justice system, the best we can demand is the benchmark of
&ldquo;beyond reasonable doubt.&rdquo; By the same token, it would be

<h3 id="Proof_vs_Confirmation">1.3.5 Proof vs. Confirmation</h3>

<p>The purported controversy surrounding whether the theory of evolution is “just
a theory” was whipped up by exploiting the failure to distinguish deductive
proofs from inductive confirmations. The charge that there is no proof for the
theory of evolution plays on the word “proof”. If by &ldquo;proof&rdquo; one
means deductive proof, then the charge is misplaced, for we ought not to insist
on deductive proof for scientific theories. The deductive proofs that we are
most familiar with are derivations of mathematic theorems from axioms or
postulates. In contrast, scientific theories are accepted as true when
they are well confirmed by evidence. Since such a confirmation is inductive, and
not deductive, it would be unreasonable to demand a deductive proof for a
scientific theory. The insistence on a deductive proof for the theory of
evolution and the refusal to accept it unless it has been proven amount to a
demand for certainty, and thus reflect a lack of understanding of how science
works. Carlo Rovelli, a theoretical physicist, has stated very clearly on
whether scientific theories can be proven:</p>

  <blockquote>Science is not about certainty. Science is about finding the most
  reliable way of thinking at the present level of knowledge. Science is
  extremely reliable; it’s not certain. In fact, not only is it not certain,
  but it’s the lack of certainty that grounds it. Scientific ideas are credible
  not because they are sure but because they’re the ones that have survived all
  the possible past critiques, and they’re the most credible because they were
  put on the table for everybody’s criticism.</blockquote>

  <blockquote style="margin-top: 12px;">The very expression “scientifically
  proven” is a contradiction in terms. There’s nothing that is scientifically
  proven. The core of science is the deep awareness that we have wrong ideas,
  we have prejudices. We have ingrained prejudices. In our conceptual structure
  for grasping reality, there might be something not appropriate, something we
  may have to revise to understand better. So at any moment we have a vision of
  reality that is effective, it’s good, it’s the best we have found so far.
  It’s the most credible we have found so far; it’s mostly correct.</blockquote>

  <blockquote style="margin-top: 12px;">But, at the same time, it’s not taken
  as certain, and any element of it is <em>a priori</em> open for
  revision...<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1"
  class="footnote">1</a></sup></blockquote>

<p>If by &ldquo;proof&rdquo; one means evidence, then it is obviously false
that there is no evidence for the theory of evolution. On the contrary, the
theory of evolution has been one of the best-confirmed theories in the history
of science. It has been accepted as one of our best scientific theories given
the wide scope of evidence that confirms and supports it.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>The issue of the evolution theory touches many people’s nerves because they perceive it as part of the clash between science and religion. What is said here in this section is not meant to be the final words on such a big topic, but only serves to clear up the confusion caused by the word “proof”. On the topic of science vs. religion, Rovelli points out that a deeper clash, which goes beyond any conflict between a scientific theory and a religious belief, lies in the difference between scientific thinking and religious thinking:</p>

  <blockquote style="margin-bottom: 12px;">The question is, Why can’t we live
  happily together and why can’t people pray to their gods and study the
  universe without this continual clash? This continual clash is a little
  unavoidable, for the opposite reason from the one often presented. It’s
  unavoidable not because science pretends to know the answers. It’s the other
  way around, because scientific thinking is a constant reminder to us that we
  don’t know the answers. In religious thinking, this is often unacceptable.
  What’s unacceptable is not a scientist who says, “I know...” but a scientist
  who says, “I don’t know, and how could you know?” Many religions, or some
  religions, or some ways of being religious, are based on the idea that there
  should be a truth that one can hold onto and not question. This way of
  thinking is naturally disturbed by a way of thinking based on continual
  revision, not just of theories but of the core ground of the way in which we
  think.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3"
