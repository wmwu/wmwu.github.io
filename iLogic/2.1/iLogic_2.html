<h1>2 Categorical Logic</h1>

<p>In Categorical Logic, we learn how to use the Venn Diagram to determine the
validity of a special type of deductive arguments called categorical
syllogisms. For example, to decide whether the following argument is valid</p>

  <p class="display"> Some fair people are apathetic and some apathetic people
  are not kind. So some fair people are not kind.</p>

<p>we translate the argument into its categorical standard form</p>

  <table class="box">
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td width="180px">Some <span class="var">A</span> are not <span
        class="var">K</span>.</td>
        <td width="340px">&nbsp;</td>
        <td width="80px">&nbsp;</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td style="border-bottom: 1px solid black">Some <span
        class="var">F</span> are <span class="var">A</span>.</td>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Some <span class="var">F</span> are not <span
        class="var">K</span>.</td>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

<p>The letters &ldquo;<span class="var">A</span>&rdquo;, &ldquo;<span
class="var">K</span>&rdquo;, and &ldquo;<span class="var">F</span>&rdquo; stand
for the three terms in the arguments</p>

  <p class="display"><span class="var">A</span>: apathetic people</p>
  <p class="display"><span class="var">K</span>: kind people</p>
  <p class="display"><span class="var">F</span>: fair people</p>

<p>Then, using a formal procedure called the Venn Diagram method, we can find
out that the form is invalid. The argument is therefore not a good argument.</p>

<h2>2.1 Categorical Statements</h2>

<p>A categorical statement expresses how two sets of things relate to each
other. For example, the statement &ldquo;All ravens are black birds&rdquo;
tells us that every member of the set ravens is also a member of the set black
birds.</p>

<p>A categorical statement is made up of four components:</p>

      <div style="width: 550px; height: 200px; margin: 0 0 -10px 60px">
      <iframe class="sc70" src="CS_Components.html" style="width: 800px; height:
      360px; border: 0; overflow: hidden"></iframe>
      </div>

<p style="margin-top: 0px">The subject term and the predicate term stand for
the two sets whose logical relation is characterized by the statement.</p>

<h3 id="Sets">2.1.1 Sets</h3>

<p>A <strong>set</strong> is a group or class of things that share certain
properties in common. For example, the set of ravens is a group of large birds
that have black feathers and a croaking cry. Each of such a bird is said to be
a member of the set.</p>

      <p>A general term such as &ldquo;ravens&rdquo; or &ldquo;dinosaurs&rdquo;
      refers to, or denotes, a set. The set of all dinosaurs that ever existed
      is called the <strong>referent</strong> of the term
      &ldquo;dinosaurs.&rdquo;</p>

      <div style="width: 550px; height: 240px; margin: 0 0 -10px 60px">
      <iframe class="sc70" src="Referent_of_Set.html" style="margin: -300px 0 0
      6px; width: 800px; height: 860px; border: 0; overflow: hidden"></iframe>
      </div>

      <p style="margin-top: 0px">A set with no member is called an
      <strong>empty set</strong>, symbolized as &empty;. For example, since
      there is no pink elephant, the term &ldquo;pink elephants&rdquo; denotes
      an empty set. Other terms that refer to empty sets include
      &ldquo;centaurs&rdquo; and &ldquo;elves&rdquo; because they are depicted
      in mythologies and do not exist in the real world.</p>

      <div style="width: 550px; height: 240px; margin: 0 0 -10px 60px">
      <iframe class="sc70" src="Empty_Set.html" style="margin: -300px 0 0 6px;
      width: 800px; height: 860px; border: 0; overflow: hidden"></iframe>
      </div>

      <p style="margin-top: 0px">The <strong>universe of discourse</strong> is
      the set of all things being discussed. If we are talking about animals,
      the universe of discourse would be the set of animals. If we are
      discussing people, the universe of discourse would be the set of
      people.</p>

      <p>Visually, the blue circle represents the set <span
      class="var">S</span> and a rectangle stands for
      the universe of discourse.</p>

      <div style="width: 550px; height: 190px; margin: 0 0 -10px 60px">
      <iframe class="sc70" src="Universe_of_Discourse.html" style="width: 800px;
      height: 360px; border: 0; overflow: hidden"></iframe>
      </div>

      <p style="margin-top: 0px">The complement of the set <span
      class="var">S</span> is the set <span class="var">non-S</span> (or <span
      class="var">S</span><span class="var3">C</span>). It contains everything
      in the universe of discourse except the members of the set <span
      class="var">S</span>. Represented visually, <span
      class="var">non-S</span> is the blue area outside the circle.</p>

      <div style="width: 550px; height: 190px; margin: 0 0 -10px 60px">
      <iframe class="sc70" src="Complement.html" style="width: 800px; height:
      360px; border: 0; overflow: hidden"></iframe>
      </div>

      <p style="margin-top: 0px">The union of a set and its complement is the
      universe of discourse. That is, <span class="var">S</span> <span
      class="var2">&cup;</span> <span class="var">S</span><span
      class="var3">C</span> <span class="var2">=</span> <span
      class="var">U</span>.</p>

      <p>The visual way of representing a set with a circle may give rise to
      the impression that a set has a clear border and we can always clearly
      and precisely determine whether something belongs to the set. However, it
      should be noted that while some sets are crisp, many are <strong>fuzzy
      sets</strong>. A fuzzy set has a grey area for whether something is its
      member. For example, there are borderline cases of whether a man is bald.
      So the set of bald men is a fuzzy set. It is more accurate to represent a
      fuzzy set as a circle with a blur boundary.</p>

      <div style="width: 550px; height: 190px; margin: 0 0 -10px 60px">
      <iframe class="sc70" src="Fuzzy_Set.html" style="width: 800px; height:
      360px; border: 0; overflow: hidden"></iframe>
      </div>

      <h3 id="Quantifiers_and_Copula">2.1.2 Quantifiers and Copula</h3>

      <p>The first word in a categorical statement is the quantifier. The
      quantifier determines the <strong>quantity</strong> of a categorical
      statement. There are two quantifiers in Categorical Logic:
      &ldquo;All&rdquo; and &ldquo;Some.&rdquo; The word &ldquo;All&rdquo; is
      the universal quantifier. It is used to say something about every member
      of the set denoted by the subject term. &ldquo;Some&rdquo; is the
      existential quantifier. It is sometimes called the particular quantifier.
      It is used to say something about at least one member of the set denoted
      by the subject term.</p>

      <p>A copula is a verb that links the subject and predicate terms
      together. In the standard categorical statement form, the only copula
      that can be used is the verb &ldquo;are.&rdquo; If a categorical
      statement is written with other verbs, it has to be rephrased using the
      standard copula &ldquo;are.&rdquo; For example,</p>

      <p class="display">Some birds cannot fly.</p>

      <p>is not a standard categorical statement. It has to be rewritten as</p>

      <p class="display">Some birds are not flyers.</p>

      <p>In doing so, we then have two terms &ldquo;birds&rdquo; and
      &ldquo;flyers&rdquo; that designate two sets. The copula is used to
      affirm or deny membership, that is, to indicate whether members of the
      first set are also members of the second set. If it affirms membership,
      then we say the categorical statement is affirmative; if it denies
      membership, then the statement is negative. Being affirmative or negative
      is called the <strong>quality</strong> of a categorical statement.</p>
    <div class="second-half">
      <h3 id="A_E_I_O_Statements">2.1.3 The <span class="var2" style="font-size: 20px;"><strong>A E I
      O</strong></span> Statements</h3>

      <p>Given two sets, it is possible that every member of the first set is
      also a member of the second set. It is also possible that none of the
      member of the first set is a member of the second set. The third
      possibility is that there is at least one member of the first set that is
      also a member of the second set. The fourth is that at least one member
      of the first set is not a member of the second set. As a result, there
      are four types of categorical statements.</p>

      <p><strong><em>The</em> <span class="var">A</span>
      <em>Statement</em></strong></p>

      <p>The <span class="var2"><strong>A</strong></span> statement is the
      universal affirmative statement. It asserts that every member of the set
      <span class="var">S</span> is also a member of the set <span
      class="var">P</span>. It has the statement form that</p>

      <p class="display">All <span class="var">S</span> are <span
      class="var">P</span>.</p>

      <p>Here <span class="var">S</span> is the variable used for the subject
      term and <span class="var">P</span> is the variable for the predicate
      term. The statement</p>

      <p class="display">All dolphins are mammals.</p>

      <p>asserts that every member of the set dolphins is also a member of the
      set mammals.</p>

      <p><strong><em>The</em> <span class="var">E</span>
      <em>Statement</em></strong></p>

      <p>The <span class="var2"><strong>E</strong></span> statement is the
      universal negative statement. It says that none of the member of the set
      <span class="var">S</span> is also a member of the set <span
      class="var">P</span>. It has the statement form that</p>

      <p class="display">No <span class="var">S</span> are <span
        class="var">P</span>.</p>

      <p>The statement</p>

      <p class="display">No bats are birds.</p>

      <p>denies any bat the membership of the set birds. In other words, the two
      sets do not share any member in common.</p>

      <p>You may wonder why we do not use</p>

      <p class="display">All <span class="var">S</span> are not <span
        class="var">P</span>.</p>

      <p>as the statement form for the <span
      class="var2"><strong>E</strong></span> statement. The reason is that the
      statement form is ambiguous. Given the context and our background
      knowledge about the world, we would sometimes read &ldquo;All <span
      class="var">S</span> are not <span class="var">P</span>&rdquo; as meaning
      &ldquo;No <span class="var">S</span> are <span
      class="var">P</span>,&rdquo; but on other occasions, we would take it to
      mean &ldquo;Some <span class="var">S</span> are not <span
      class="var">P</span>.&rdquo; For example, given what we know about
      emeralds, we would take &ldquo;All emeralds are not blue&rdquo; to mean
      that no emeralds are blue. However, given what we know about apples, we
      would not misinterpret &ldquo;All apples are not green&rdquo; as meaning
      that no apples are green. Rather, we would take it as an emphatic way of
      saying that some apples are not green. To avoid confusion, logicians
      choose to use the form &ldquo;No <span class="var">S</span> are <span
      class="var">P</span>&rdquo; for the <span
      class="var2"><strong>E</strong></span> statement.</p>

      <p><strong><em>The</em> <span class="var">I</span>
      <em>Statement</em></strong></p>

      <p>The <span class="var2"><strong>I</strong></span> statement is the
      particular affirmative statement. It asserts that at least one member of
      the set <span class="var">S</span> is also a member of the set <span
      class="var">P</span>. It has the statement form that</p>

      <p class="display">Some <span class="var">S</span> are <span
        class="var">P</span>.</p>

      <p>The statement</p>

      <p class="display">Some dinosaurs are carnivores.</p>

      <p>asserts that at least there is one dinosaur that is also a
      carnivore.</p>

      <p><strong><em>The</em> <span class="var">O</span>
      <em>Statement</em></strong></p>

      <p>The <span class="var2"><strong>O</strong></span> statement is the
      particular negative statement. It denies at least one member of the set
      <span class="var">S</span> the membership of the set <span
      class="var">P</span>. That is, it claims that at least one member of the
      set <span class="var">S</span> is not a member of the set <span
      class="var">P</span>. It has the statement form that</p>

      <p class="display">Some <span class="var">S</span> are not <span
        class="var">P</span>.</p>

      <p>The statement</p>

      <p class="display">Some reptiles are not animals with legs.</p>

      <p>asserts that there is at least one reptile that is not an animal with
      leg.</p>

      <h3 id="Venn_Diagrams_for_Statements">2.1.4 Venn Diagrams for
      Statements</h3>

      <p>A categorical statement has a subject term and a predicate term. We use
      two overlapping circles to represent the two sets denoted by the two
      terms.</p>

      <div style="width: 550px; height: 190px; margin: 0 0 -10px 60px">
      <iframe class="sc70" src="2_Circles_Venn_Diagram.html" style="margin:
      -250px 0 0 0; width: 800px; height: 720px; border: 0; overflow:
      hidden"></iframe>
      </div>

      <p>The two overlapping circles form three areas: area <em>&alpha;</em>,
      <em>&beta;</em> and <em>&gamma;</em>. Everything in the area
      <em>&alpha;</em> is a member of <span class="var">S</span>, but not a
      member of <span class="var">P</span>. Everything in the area
      <em>&beta;</em> is a member of <span class="var">S</span>, and a member
      of <span class="var">P</span>. Everything in the area <em>&gamma;</em> is
      a member of <span class="var">P</span>, but not a member of <span
      class="var">S</span>.</p>
