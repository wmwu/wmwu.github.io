      <h2>1.2 Arguments</h2>

      <p>An <strong>argument</strong> is a set of statements or evaluative
      sentences in which one of them is called the <strong>conclusion</strong>
      of the argument and the others (called the <strong>premises</strong> of
      the argument) are put forward as reasons for accepting the conclusion. In
      the following example,</p>

      <table class="box">
          <tr>
            <td width="360px" style="border-bottom: 1px solid
            black;">Secondhand smoking is a health hazard.</td> <td
            width="160px"></td>
            <td width="80px"></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td class="bottom">Smoking should be banned in public areas.</td>
            <td>&nbsp;</td>
            <td><span class="label">1.2a</span></td>
          </tr>
      </table>

      <p>the premise &ldquo;Secondhand smoking is a health hazard&rdquo; is
      used to support the conclusion &ldquo;Smoking should be banned in public
      areas.&rdquo;</p>

      <h3 id="Reasons_vs_Causes">1.2.1 Reasons vs. Causes</h3>

      <p>It is important to distinguish between reasons for accepting a belief
      and causes that lead someone to hold a belief. For example, a
      person&rsquo;s fear of death may cause her to believe that there is life
      after death, but such a fear should not be considered as a good reason,
      that is, good evidence that can be used to support the truth of the
      belief. Would you regard the following as a good argument?</p>

      <table class="box">
          <tr>
            <td width="220px" style="border-bottom: 1px solid black;">I fear
            death.</td>
            <td width="300px">&nbsp;</td>
            <td width="80px">&nbsp;</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td class="bottom">There is life after death.</td>
            <td>&nbsp;</td>
            <td>&nbsp;</td>
          </tr>
      </table>

      <p>In examining arguments, we focus on reasons for or against a belief,
      not its causes. The cause of a belief may be studied or dealt with in
      psychology, psychoanalysis and psychotherapy.</p>

      <h3 id="Distinguishing_Premises_from_Conclusion">1.2.2 Distinguishing
      Premises from Conclusion</h3>

      <p>Certain key words or phrases such as</p>

      <p class="display">since<br>
         because<br>
         for<br>
         as<br>
         in that<br>
         for the reason(s) that</p>

      <p>can help us tell which sentences in an argument are the premises. They
      are called premise indicators.</p>
      <p>Others such as</p>
      <p class="display">therefore<br>
        so<br>
        it follows that<br>
        consequently<br>
        accordingly<br>
        hence<br>
        as a result</p>

      <p>can help us identify which sentence is the conclusion. They are called
      conclusion indicators.</p>

      <p>In the following argument</p>

      <p class="display"> All censorship is unconstitutional. Since any form of
      censorship hinders the freedom of speech, and all measures that violate
      the First Amendment are unconstitutional.</p>

      <p>the word &ldquo;Since&rdquo; indicates that the sentences &ldquo;any
      form of censorship hinders the freedom of speech&rdquo; and &ldquo;all
      measures that violate the First Amendment are unconstitutional&rdquo; are
      premises. After the premises are identified, it becomes clear that the
      first sentence &ldquo;all censorship is unconstitutional&rdquo; is the
      conclusion.</p>

      <p>If an argument does not contain any premise or conclusion indicator,
      then we would need to rely on the context to identify the conclusion.
      Normally, the sentence (quite often the topic sentence of a paragraph)
      that declares a stance on a controversial issue is the conclusion.</p>

      <h3 id="Making_Claims_in_an_Argument">1.2.3 Making Claims in an
      Argument</h3>

      <p>When someone presents an argument, the person is making two kinds of
      claims:</p>

      <h4>1. The factual/evaluative claim</h4>

      <p>The point of offering an argument is to present reasons to support a
      belief or position in dispute. If a premise is a statement, then the
      person is claiming that you should accept it as true. She is thus making
      a <strong>factual claim</strong>. If a premise is an evaluative sentence,
      then she is making an <strong>evaluative claim</strong> that you should
      agree with the preferences or values expressed in the premise.</p>

      <p>For example, in the argument (1.2b)</p>

      <table class="box">
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td width="500px" style="border-bottom: 1px solid black;">Fossils
            of feathered dinosaurs with wings were discovered in China.</td>
            <td width="20px"></td>
            <td width="80px"></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td class="bottom">Birds evolved from dinosaurs.</td>
            <td>&nbsp;</td>
            <td><span class="label">1.2b</span></td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <p>the person is making a factual claim about the discovered fossils of
      dinosaurs with feathers. By contrast, in the next argument (1.2c)</p>

      <table class="box">
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td width="500px" style="border-bottom: 1px solid black;">It&rsquo;s inhumane to
              let terminally ill patients suffer unnecessary pains.</td>
            <td width="20px"></td>
            <td width="80px"></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td class="bottom">Doctor-assisted suicide should be legal.</td>
            <td>&nbsp;</td>
            <td><span class="label">1.2c</span></td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <p>the person is making an evaluative claim about the inhumaneness of
      unnecessary suffering.</p>

      <h4>2. The inferential claim</h4>

      <p>The <strong>inferential claim</strong> is the claim a person is making
      about how her premises support her conclusion. In (1.2b), in addition to
      the factual claim, there is a second claim about how the discovery of the
      fossils serves as a compelling reason for agreeing with the conclusion
      regarding the evolution of birds from dinosaurs. Likewise, in (1.2c),
      there is a claim about how the inhumaneness of terminally ill
      patients&rsquo; unnecessary suffering lends force to the legalization of
      doctor-assisted suicide.</p>

      <p>The inferential claim is a critical link between the premises
      and the conclusion. Without it, there would be no argument. It is what
      distinguishes an argument from a report or an explanation. For instance,
      the following passage</p>

      <p class="display">Seventy thousand United Food and Commercial Workers
      Union (UFCW) workers are on strike against four supermarket chains in
      Southern California. The main contention is over medical benefits. The
      workers demand affordable health care while the companies seek to curb
      their health care costs.</p>

      <p>is a report explaining why the  strike happens. It is not an argument
      because there is no inferential link among the sentences.</p>

      <h3 id="Accessing_the_Two_Claims">1.2.4 Assessing the Two Claims</h3>

      <p>In order to decide whether to go along with an argument based on
      rational thinking, we need to examine the argument critically. This means
      to evaluate the two claims to see if they hold water. The following flow
      chart shows the whole procedure of argument evaluation. P<sub>1</sub>
      stands for the 1<sup>st</sup> premise and P<sub>n</sub> is the
      <em>n</em><sup>th</sup> premise. C is the conclusion. For each premise,
      we need to decide whether it is a statement or an evaluative sentence. If
      it is a statement, we then decide whether it is true or false. If it is
      an evaluative sentence, we then find out if it is acceptable or
      unacceptable based on our value standards. Next, we examine the
      inferential claim. If the argument is claimed to be 100% supporting, then
      it is deductive; otherwise, it is inductive. For a deductive argument, we
      then examine whether it is valid. For an inductive argument, we assess
      its supporting strength. If the strength is greater than 50%, then the
      induction is strong. If it is equal to or less than 50%, then the
      induction is weak. We will learn more about these key concepts in 1.3.

      <h3 id="Classifying_Arguments" style="margin-top: 0px">1.2.5 Classifying
      Arguments</h3>

      <p>There are different ways to classify arguments into various types. One
      way is to distinguish factual arguments from evaluative arguments. The
      other is to group them into deductive and inductive arguments.</p>

      <p><em><strong>Factual/Evaluative Arguments</strong></em></p>

      <p>Arguments consisting of only statements are factual arguments. If an
      argument contains one or more evaluative sentences, then it is an
      evaluative argument.</p>

      <p><em><strong>Deductive/Inductive Arguments</strong></em></p>

      <p>Whether an argument is deductive or inductive is determined by the
      inferential claim made in the argument. We will study this important
      distinction in the next section.</p>
