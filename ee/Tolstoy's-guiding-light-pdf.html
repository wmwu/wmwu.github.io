  <p style="margin-top: 12px;">In October 1910 Leo Tolstoy left his home at
  Yasnaya Polyana, 120 miles south of Moscow, in a final attempt to separate
  himself from his wealth, possessions and family. Just over a week after his
  departure he died of pneumonia in the stationmasterâ€™s house at Astapovo railway station.</p>
  <p>The philosophical writings of the author of War and Peace inspired followers from Moscow to Croydon and led to the creation of a Christian anarchist reform movement. Charlotte Alston examines the activities and influence of Tolstoy's disciples.</p>
