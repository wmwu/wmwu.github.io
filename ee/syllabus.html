Please refer to it throughout      the semester to remind yourself of what is expected of you and how to      learn the subject well. The best general strategy is to read the materials      thoroughly, attend class, take good notes and complete assignments on      time. To have satisfactory performance in this class, you need to spend      around 9 hours (3 hours in class, 6 hours outside of class) per week on      this course.</p>    <h2>The Course</h2>    <p>PHIL 5 is an introductory course on theories of environmental ethics and      how they are applied to sustainability and environmental issues. Both      traditional and contemporary, Western and non-Western theories are studied      to learn various outlooks on how humans should live in nature, including      how we relate to the environment, the future generations and other      species. The ideas and principles are then used to find solutions to the      challenges we face today such as resource depletion, pollution, climate      change and species extinction.</p>    <table border="0">      <tbody valign="top">        <tr>          <td width="25%"><strong>Recommended Preparation</strong></td>          <td>Reading Level 5, English Level 4, Eligibility for English 2,            Introduction to Logic</td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td width="25%"><strong>Transfer Status</strong></td>          <td>UC, CSU</td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td width="25%"><strong>Course Format</strong></td>          <td>Lecture and Discussion</td>        </tr>        <tr valign="top">          <td width="25%"><strong>Objectives/SLO</strong></td>          <td>Upon successful completion of this course, the student will be            able to:            <ol type="A">              <li>Explain and articulate the major environmental ethical                theories</li>              <li>Summarize and critique arguments for and against various                theories</li>              <li>Develop and formulate personal outlook by synthesizing various                perspectives</li>              <li>Identify the major problems in environmental ethics and                explore solutions</li>              <li>Relate environmental ethics to other fields such as ecology,                sociology and the development of new technologies</li>              <li>Apply the theories to resolve contemporary environmental                issues</li>            </ol>          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>    <h2>Textbook</h2>    <p>Schmidtz, D., &amp; Willott, E.

Calendar entries      and to-do items are subject to change.</p>    <h2>Attendance and Add/Drop Classes</h2>    <ul>      <li>If you miss the first class without informing me of your absence in        advance, you will be dropped from the class.</li>      <li>During the first two weeks, you will be dropped if I think you are no        longer attending class, or if you miss one class without a legitimate        excuse. If you miss a class, inform me promptly via Canvas Messages or        Butte College e-mail to avoid being dropped. </li>      <li>The last day to drop without a “W” appearing on transcript: <br>        <dl>          <dd>in person 2/1/2018</dd>          <dd>online 2/4/2018</dd>        </dl>      </li>      <li>The last day to drop for a “W” <strong>without</strong> instructor’s        signature: <br>        <dl>          <dd>in person 3/15/2018</dd>          <dd>online 3/18/2018</dd>        </dl>        To drop after this date students need an instructor’s signature        certifying serious and compelling reason for dropping.</li>      <li>In the first eight weeks, you will be dropped if one of the following        applies:<br>        <ul>          <li>have two unexcused absences in a row;</li>          <li>have four or more absences (regardless of being excused or not);</li>          <li>miss 20% or more class works.</li>        </ul>        <div style="margin-top: 12px">Send me a Canvas message or Butte College          e-mail promptly if you miss two classes in a row. A doctor’s note is          required if you have two consecutive absences due to illness or          injuries. You also need to submit a written memo from your coach for          each absence for campus sports team events.</div>      </li>      <li>The last day to drop for a “W” <strong>with</strong> an instructor’s        signature certifying serious and compelling reasons for dropping        classes:<br>        <dl>          <dd>4/19/2018</dd>        </dl>        After this date students must see a Counselor to petition for late        withdrawal from classes. <br>        See <a target="_blank" href="http://www.butte.edu/admissions/AcademicCalendar.html">Academic
          Calendar</a> for other important dates and deadlines.</li>      <li>Attendance will be taken throughout the semester. Make sure you sign        the attendance sheet before leaving the classroom. Failure to do so will        result in being marked as absent.</li>      <li>In the spirit of fostering a good learning environment, do your best        to avoid interrupting the class—being late, leaving early or exiting and        returning to the classroom.</li>    </ul>    <h2>The Use of Technologies, Computer and Internet</h2>    <p>Laptops or handheld devices are needed for in-class as well as online      activities. You should bring them to class every time. Be sure to follow      the proper protocols when using these devices in class.</p>    <p>You need to ask permission in advance to take photos or record lectures.      Please follow the proper policies and etiquette.</p>    <p>To read materials posted on Canvas and to complete online assignments,      you will need to have online access at least 1–2 hours daily.</p>    <p>Utilize the resources listed in Student Support on Canvas. You can ask <a        href="http://www.butte.edu/currentstudents/help_on_campus/help_academic/student_tech_support/index.html">        Student Technical Support</a> for assistance if you run into      difficulties. It is recommended that if needed, you take mini courses to      improve your computer skills.</p>    <p>It is your responsibility to make sure your computer or device works      properly and has a reliable Internet connection. It is also a good      practice to have a backup plan to avoid missing the deadline due to      computer or Internet problems. <strong>Computer/device glitches or loss        of Internet connection will not be accepted as excuses for making up        assignments.</strong></p>    <h2>Assignments and Assessments</h2>    <h3>Reading Assignments</h3>    <p>The textbook is to provide basic information of the subject matter.      Additional materials and readings are provided on Canvas.</p>    <p>Philosophical texts can be hard to read and difficult to understand. It      is quite common that one needs to read the text several times to fully      grasp its main points. To help yourself gain a better understanding of a      topic and become better prepared to participate in the discussion, it is      paramount that you read the assigned materials before the topic is      discussed in class and online.</p>    <ul>      <li>Read a chapter or an article as soon as you can after it is assigned        or recommended.</li>      <li>Outline what you read, take notes and jot down questions.</li>      <li>Do online search to learn more about new terms and philosophical        views.</li>      <li>Use questions for reflection and discussion to make sure that you have        grasped the key points.</li>      <li>Reread the chapter or the article at least one more time after the        lecture and class discussion to make sure you understand the finer        points. Revise and update your notes, and use them for writing        assignments.</li>      <li>Your reading comprehension will be evaluated via essay questions on        Canvas. <span style="font-weight: bold;">There is no make-up for missed          online submissions. </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">No </span><span          style="font-weight: bold;">paper
          copies will be accepted; neither will late submissions or          resubmissions.</span> If you miss an assignment, you are encouraged to        make up the lost points through extra-credit.</li>    </ul>    <h3>Writing Assignments</h3>    <p>The amount of writing will exceed the 1,500-word requirement. The types      of writing include essay questions, forum discussions and a reflection      paper. All the writings are to be submitted on Canvas and are graded on      both form and content. <strong>There is no make-up. </strong><span style="font-weight: bold;">No
        </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">paper copies will be accepted;        neither will late submissions or resubmissions.</span></p>    <h4>Essay Questions</h4>    <p>Essay questions are used to assess your comprehension and philosophical      thinking.</p>    <h4>Canvas Discussions</h4>    <p>We will use Canvas Discussions to foster open and in-depth discussions of      philosophical and environmental issues. It’s a great way to apply critical      thinking, share viewpoints and learn from one another.</p>    <h4>Reflection Paper</h4>    <p>By the end of the semester, you are to turn in a reflection paper on what      you have learned in the semester and how they have shaped your      environmental philosophy. Keeping a journal of your thoughts on various      topics throughout the semester is a good way to prepare the paper.</p>    <h2>Extra-credit</h2>    <h3>Extra-credit Assignments or Activities</h3>    <p>Extra-credit assignments or activities will be announced both in class      and on Canvas. They are optional, but you can earn extra-credit points if      you choose to do the assignment or participate in the activity.</p>    <h3>Extra-credit for Class Attendance</h3>    <p>Please take notice that attendance is not part of your grade, but you can      earn extra-credit points by keeping your absences to a minimum. It is      understandable that sometimes students can’t help but miss a class due to      illness or other reasons. So don’t force yourself to come to the class      when you are sick. Both excused and unexcused absences count toward the      number of absences. You can earn up to 40 points with good attendance.</p>    <table align="center" width="400px">      <tbody>        <tr>          <th height="50px" width="250px">Number of Absences<br>          </th>          <th height="50px" width="150px">Extra-credit</th>        </tr>        <tr align="center">          <td>0</td>          <td>40 points</td>        </tr>        <tr align="center">          <td>1<br>          </td>          <td>30 points</td>        </tr>        <tr align="center">          <td>2<br>          </td>          <td>20 points</td>        </tr>        <tr align="center">          <td>3<br>          </td>          <td>10 points<br>          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>    <h2>Grading</h2>    <p>It is important that we study for self-improvement and self-fulfillment,      and not just for grades. Your grade is to help you gauge what you have      learned in a course. By letting go of the anxiety about the grade, you      will find studying a subject matter much more enjoyable. As a result, you      are more likely to spend time learning the material and earn a good grade.      Only a hard-earned grade that truly reflects what you have learned can      forge self-confidence.</p>    <p>Your final grade will be determined by the percentage of the total points      you earn:</p>    <table align="center" width="300px">      <tbody>        <tr>          <th height="50px" width="150px">Percentage</th>          <th height="50px" width="150px">Grade</th>        </tr>        <tr align="center">          <td>90-100%</td>          <td>A</td>        </tr>        <tr align="center">          <td>80-89%</td>          <td>B</td>        </tr>        <tr align="center">          <td>70-79%</td>          <td>C</td>        </tr>        <tr align="center">          <td>60-69%</td>          <td>D</td>        </tr>        <tr align="center">          <td>below 60%</td>          <td>F</td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>    <p>The scale may be lowered, but will not be raised. You can monitor your      progress and grade percentage on Canvas.</p>    <h2>Cheating and Plagiarism</h2>    <p>Students who cheat or commit plagiarism will receive an F grade for the      assignment or for the course, depending on the seriousness of the offense.      Furthermore, they will be subject to disciplinary action.

We pledge to respect all people regardless of sexuality,      gender identity, ethnicity and religious backgrounds.</p>    The most important guideline to remember is the Golden Rule—Do not do to the    others what you do not want done to yourself. As you are respectful to your    teacher and classmates, they will treat you in the same way. Please comply    with the following etiquette:    <ul>      <li>Always conduct yourself in an appropriate and respectable manner.</li>      <li>Attend to personal needs before coming to class.</li>      <li>Come to class on time and avoid leaving early or in the middle of a        session.</li>      <li>Respect other people even if you disagree with their views.</li>      <li>Wait for your turn to ask questions or express your viewpoints; do not        chitchat in the classroom.</li>      <li>No food, drink or chewing gum.</li>    </ul>    <p>For student rights and privileges, and grounds for disciplinary action,      see <a title="Academic Policies and Procedures" href="http://www.butte.edu/currentstudents/references/handbooks_and_policies/academic-policies-and-procedures.html"        target="_blank">Academic
        Policies and Procedures</a>.</p>    <h2>Tips for Success</h2>    <p>To be successful in the class and earn the grade you desire, you need to      manage your time wisely and put in your effort.</p>    <ul>      <li>Try your best not to miss classes.</li>      <li>Read the reading assignment and give the subject some thought before        the discussion in class and online.</li>      <li>Review lecture notes as soon as possible after class.</li>      <li>Ask questions if something is unclear to you.</li>      <li>Reflect upon the issues or questions as often as possible.</li>      <li>Draft your answers to essay questions and revise them before        submitting them.</li>      <li>Don’t wait until the last minute to complete online assignments.</li>    </ul>    <h2>Getting Help</h2>    You can find resources for academic help, personal help and help for unique    needs by visiting <a target="_blank" title="Help on Campus" href="http://www.butte.edu/currentstudents/help_on_campus/">Help
      on Campus</a>.    <p>The best way to get help with coursework is to ask questions in class.      People shy away from asking questions because they are afraid of appearing      stupid. It is very likely that if you do not understand something, there      is someone else in the class who is suffering from an identical lack of      understanding. You will be doing your classmates a service by asking      questions.</p>    <p>If something is unclear to you or you are having difficulty learning the      material, please feel free to come to see me during my office hours. If      you cannot meet with me during the regular hours, I will be glad to      schedule an appointment. Do not wait until it is too late.</p>    <p>The Center for Academic Success (CAS) provides academic support services      to Butte College students.
