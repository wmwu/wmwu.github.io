      <p>This workshop will be introducing permaculture and urban farming as a food and economic solution. The goal of this workshop is to illustrate: How regenerative agriculture and policultures can transform our monocrop food production into an ecologically diverse local food production; how local economic systems can work with social systems while building community and resilience of a bioregion. This workshop will provide examples of solutions that can be applied. (If you attended previous Permaculture workshops, please choose other events for this extra-credit.)</p>

      <p>Women significantly lag behind men in the number of mathematics, engineering, and science degrees they earn, especially at the graduate school level.

<p>12:30-1:45 p.m. Center For Excellence (Library 210)</p>
      <p>In the United States, the rise in globalization, multiculturalism, and the women's movement has created a backlash fueled by sexism, misogyny, and violence. What does the 21st century hold for American patriarchy? Are men finished? Will men be able to throw off old notions of masculinity and adapt to our changing world?
