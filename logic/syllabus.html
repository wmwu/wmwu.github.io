Please refer to it throughout   the semester to remind yourself of what is expected of you and how to   learn the subject well. The best general strategy is to attend class, take   good notes, do homework every time, and study for the tests. To do well in   this class, you need to commit, for each class hour, at least 2 hours of   study time outside of class.</p>  <h2>The Course</h2>  <p>PHIL 6 is an introductory course in logic. It is intended to help   students learn how to analyze and evaluate arguments. By studying the   basic principles of reasoning and common fallacies, it is hoped that   students will develop the ability to think critically and be able to make   good judgments on various arguments concerning the affairs of daily life.   In short, we study logic to become a good thinker. We want to be able to   evaluate arguments so as to decide whether we should accept a belief, or   support a position, on the basis of the arguments for or against it. </p>  <p>In this class, we will study the basic concepts of logic, examine the   dichotomy between values and facts, and learn to distinguish deduction   from induction. Two formal systems of deduction will be introduced so that   students can master the basics in logic and also be ready for the more   advanced study of symbolic logic. The first one is Categorical Logic. In   it we will learn how to use the Venn Diagram to determine the validity of   categorical syllogisms. In the second system Propositional Logic, we will   learn how to symbolize arguments and use the truth table to determine   their validity. In addition, we will study informal fallacies.</p>  <table border="0">   <tbody valign="top">    <tr>     <td width="25%"><strong>Recommended Preparation</strong></td>     <td>Reading Level 4, English Level 4, Math Level 4<br>     </td>    </tr>    <tr>     <td width="25%"><strong>Transfer Status</strong></td>     <td>CSU A3</td>    </tr>    <tr>     <td width="25%"><strong>Course Format</strong></td>     <td>Lecture and Discussion</td>    </tr>    <tr valign="top">     <td width="25%"><strong>Objectives/SLO</strong></td>     <td>Upon successful completion of this course, the student will be      able to:      <ol type="A">       <li>Evaluate, analyze and criticize arguments.</li>       <li>Organize beliefs and ideas in an orderly manner.</li>       <li>Distinguish and evaluate deductive and inductive arguments.</li>       <li>Identify and label various informal fallacies.</li>      </ol>     </td>    </tr>   </tbody>  </table>  <h2>Textbook</h2>  <p>Wu W. <em>iLogic</em>.

Calendar entries and to-do items are subject to change.</p>  <h2>Attendance and Add/Drop Classes</h2>  <ul>   <li>If you miss the first class without informing me of your absence in    advance, you will be dropped from the class.</li>   <li>During the first two weeks, you will be dropped if I think you are no    longer attending class, or if you miss one class without a legitimate    excuse. If you miss a class, inform me promptly via Canvas Messages    or Butte College e-mail to avoid being dropped.   <li>The last day to drop without a “W” appearing on transcript: <br>    <dl>     <dd>in person 9/1/2016</dd>     <dd>online 9/4/2016</dd>    </dl>    If you receive a “W”, it would count as one attempt of taking the class.    See <a target="_blank" href="http://www.butte.edu/district_info/calendars/academic.html">Academic

You should bring them to class every time. Be sure to follow the proper protocols when using these devices in class.</p>    <p>You need to ask permission in advance to take photos or record lectures.    Please follow the proper policies and etiquette.</p>    <p>To access <em>iLogic</em> online and materials posted on Canvas, and to    complete online assignments, you will need to have online access at least    1–2 hours daily.</p>    <p>Utilize the resources listed in Student Support on Canvas. You can ask <a    href="http://www.butte.edu/currentstudents/help_on_campus/help_academic/student_tech_support/index.html">Student    Technical Support</a> for assistance if you run into difficulties. It is    recommended that if needed, you take mini courses to improve your computer    skills.</p>    <p>It is your responsibility to make sure your computer or device works    properly and has a reliable Internet connection. It is also a good practice    to have a backup plan to avoid missing the deadline due to computer or    Internet problems. <strong>Computer/device glitches or loss of Internet    connection will not be accepted as excuses for making up    assignments.</strong></p>    <h2>Assignments and Assessments</h2>      <h3>Reading Assignments</h3>        <p>The textbooks are to provide basic materials for the subject matter.         Additional readings will be provided on Canvas.</p>        <p>Philosophical texts can be hard to read and difficult to understand.        It is quite common that one needs to read the text several times to        fully grasp its main points. To help yourself gain a better        understanding of a subject, it is paramount that you read the assigned        materials before it is discussed in class or online.</p>        <ul>         <li>Read a section or an article as soon as you can after it is         assigned or recommended.</li>         <li>Take notes and jot down questions while you are reading.</li>         <li>Reread the section or the article at least one more time after the         lecture and discussion to make sure you understand the finer         points.</li>         <li>Your reading comprehension will be evaluated via essay questions         on Canvas. <span style="font-weight: bold;">There is no make-up for         missed online submissions. No late submission, resubmission or paper         copy will be accepted.</span> If you miss an assignment, you are         encouraged to make up the lost points through extra-credit.</li>        </ul>      <h3>Homework</h3>        <p>Homework is an important part of the course work. Doing homework is        the most effective way to prepare for tests. You are encouraged to form        study groups and use online communication tools such as Skype or FaceTime to help each other with homework.</p>      <ul>       <li>If you miss a class, you should check the calendar on Canvas to find       out if there is an assignment.</li>       <li>Make sure your computer and Internet connection work properly. Avoid       doing the assignment at the last moment so that if computer problems       occur, you would still have enough time to do the homework.</li>       <li>For many exercises, you can check your answers online. <strong>The       results are not part of your grade.</strong> You can practice as many       times as you like.</li>       <li>Find out which questions you have difficulty with and ask questions       during the review.</li>       <li>Homework assignments will be assessed via in-class exercises on the       dates they are due. The questions in in-class exercises are chosen from       the questions in homework. <strong>Since they are part of class       participation, there are no make-ups for missed in-class       exercises.</strong></li>      </ul>      <h3>Tests</h3>      <p>In-class tests are given periodically to monitor your progress. They       typically contain questions similar to homework problems.</p>      <ul>       <li>There will be 8–10 tests for the semester.</li>       <li>Each test is worth 40–60 points.</li>       <li><strong>There is no make-up for missed tests. The first two missed         tests will be dropped.</strong></li>       <li><strong>If no test is missed, the lowest two tests will be dropped.</strong><br>       </li>       <li>If you miss a class, you should check the calendar on Canvas to        see whether there will be a test in the next class.</li>      </ul>      <h3>Final Exam</h3>      <p>The final exam will cover all the chapters in <em>iLogic</em>. It is       worth 200 points.</p>      <h3>Writing Assignments</h3>       <p>The amount of writing will exceed the 1,500-word requirement. The       types of writing include essay questions and forum discussions. All the       writings are to be submitted on Canvas. <strong>There is no make-up, and       no late submission, resubmission or paper copy will be       accepted.</strong></p>       <h4>Essay Questions</h4>         <p>Essay questions are used to assess your comprehension and         philosophical thinking. Your answers are graded on both form and         content. You need to complete and submit the answer by the deadline.         </p>       <h4>Canvas Discussions</h4>         <p>We will use Canvas Discussions to foster open and in-depth         discussions of philosophical and religious issues. It’s a great way to         apply critical thinking, share viewpoints and learn from one         another.</p>  <h2>Extra-credit</h2>    <h3>Extra-credit Assignments or Activities</h3>      <p>Extra-credit assignments or activities will be announced both in class      and on Canvas. They are optional, but you can earn extra-credit points if      you choose to do the assignment or participate in the activity.</p>    <h3>Extra-credit for Class Attendance</h3>      <p>Please take notice that attendance is not part of your grade, but you      can earn extra-credit points by keeping your absences to a minimum. It is      understandable that sometimes students can’t help but miss a class due to      illness or other reasons. So don’t force yourself to come to the class      when you are sick. Both excused and unexcused absences count toward the      number of absences. You can earn up to 40 points with good attendance.<br>      </p>      <table align="center" width="400px">       <tbody>        <tr>         <th height="50px" width="250px">Number of Absences<br>         </th>         <th height="50px" width="150px">Extra-credit</th>        </tr>        <tr align="center">         <td>0</td>         <td>40 points</td>        </tr>        <tr align="center">         <td>1<br>         </td>         <td>30 points</td>        </tr>        <tr align="center">         <td>2<br>         </td>         <td>20 points</td>        </tr>        <tr align="center">         <td>3<br>         </td>         <td>10 points<br>         </td>        </tr>       </tbody>      </table>  <h2>Grading</h2>    <p>It is important that we study for self-improvement and self-fulfillment,    and not just for grades. Your grade is to help you gauge what you have    learned in a course. By letting go of the anxiety about the grade, you will    find studying a subject matter much more enjoyable. As a result, you are    more likely to spend time learning the material and earn a good grade. Only    a hard-earned grade that truly reflects what you have learned can forge    self-confidence.</p>    <p>The purpose of homework, in-class assessments and tests is two-fold:    first, to provide you with feedback on your progress in the course; second,    to provide me with some objective data I can use in establishing individual    final grades. Your final grade will be determined by the percentage of the    total points you earn:</p>    <table align="center" width="300px">     <tbody>      <tr>       <th height="50px" width="150px">Percentage</th>       <th height="50px" width="150px">Grade</th>      </tr>      <tr align="center">       <td>90-100%</td>       <td>A</td>      </tr>      <tr align="center">       <td>80-89%</td>       <td>B</td>      </tr>      <tr align="center">       <td>70-79%</td>       <td>C</td>      </tr>      <tr align="center">       <td>60-69%</td>       <td>D</td>      </tr>      <tr align="center">       <td>below 60%</td>       <td>F</td>      </tr>     </tbody>    </table>    <p>The scale may be lowered, but will not be raised. You can monitor your     progress and grade percentage on Canvas.</p>  <h2>Cheating and Plagiarism</h2>    <p>Students who cheat or commit plagiarism will receive an F grade for the    assignment or for the course, depending on the seriousness of the offense.    Furthermore, they will be subject to disciplinary action. (Cf. Policy 3.21    Student Rights and Conduct) See also <a    href="Academic%20Honesty%20Syllabus%20Attachment%20updated%20SP%2014.pdf"    target="_blank">Butte College Academic Honesty and Accommodations</a> for    more details. Remember, your integrity is far more precious than your    grade.</p>  <h2>Open, Safe and Respectful Learning Environment</h2>    <p>This is <strong><em>our</em></strong> class and it is important that we    work together to establish an open, safe and respectful learning environment.    We pledge to respect all people regardless of sexuality, gender identity,    ethnicity and religious backgrounds.</p>    <p>The most important guideline to remember is the Golden Rule—Do not do to    the others what you do not want done to yourself. As you are respectful to    your teacher and classmates, they will treat you in the same way. Please    comply with the following etiquette:</p>    <ul>     <li>Always conduct yourself in an appropriate and respectable manner.</li>     <li>Attend to personal needs before coming to class.<br>     </li>     <li>Come to class on time and avoid leaving early or in the middle of a      session.</li>     <li>Respect other people even if you disagree with their views.</li>     <li>Wait for your turn to ask questions or express your viewpoints; do not      chitchat in the classroom.</li>     <li>No food, drink or chewing gum.</li>    </ul>    <h2>Tips for Success</h2>      <p>To be successful in the class and earn the grade you desire, you need      to manage your time wisely and put in your effort.</p>      <ul>       <li>Try your best not to miss classes.</li>       <li>Read the reading assignment before you come to the class.</li>       <li>Review course materials as soon as possible after class.</li>       <li>Ask questions if something is unclear to you.</li>       <li>Do homework to see whether you understand a topic.</li>       <li>Don’t wait until the last minute to complete online assignments.</li>       <li>Form study groups to study together.</li>       <li>Ask the logic tutor, if available, or me for help.</li>      </ul>  <h2>Getting Help</h2>    <p>The best way to get help is to ask questions in class. People shy away     from asking questions because they are afraid of appearing stupid. It is     very likely that if you do not understand something, there is someone else     in the class who is suffering from an identical lack of understanding. You     will be doing your classmates a service by asking questions.</p>    <p>If something is unclear to you or you are having difficulty learning the    material, please feel free to come to see me during my office hours. If you    cannot meet with me during the regular hours, I will be glad to schedule an    appointment. Do not wait until it is too late.</p> <p>The Center for    Academic Success (CAS) provides academic support services to Butte College    students.

A student with a      disability who will be requesting a modification, accommodation, or      access to an auxiliary aid is required and responsible for identifying      himself/herself to the instructor and, if desired, to the Disabled      Student Programs and Services (DSPS) office. Students who consult or      request assistance from DSPS regarding specific modifications,      accommodations or use of auxiliary aids will be required to meet      timelines and procedural requirements established by the DSPS office.</li>     <li>If a student believes that he or she may need an accommodation for a      disability, please make an appointment to see me during my office hours      or initiate contact with the Office of Disabled Student Programs and      Services.</li>    </ul>     <h3>Alternate Media Statement:</h3>     <ul>     <li>Students with a print disability-- a visual limitation or reading      difficulty that limits access to traditional print materials-- may      request printed materials in alternate media. Examples of alternate      media formats include electronic format (e.g., text on CD), Braille,      tactile graphics, audiotape, and large print. Students can make      alternate media requests through the Office of Disabled Student Programs      and Services.</li>    </ul>  <h2>Revision of Syllabus</h2>    <p>The syllabus is subject to revision as needed throughout the    semester.</p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <p align="center">&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p> </body></html>
