Please refer to it throughout      the semester to remind yourself of what is expected of you and how to      learn the subject well. The best general strategy is to attend class, take      good notes, do homework every time, and study for the tests. To do well in      this class, you need to commit, for each class hour, at least 2 hours of      study time outside of class.</p>    <h2>The Course</h2>    <p>PHIL 6 is an introductory course in logic. It is intended to help      students learn how to analyze and evaluate arguments. By studying the      basic principles of reasoning and common fallacies, it is hoped that      students will develop the ability to think critically and be able to make      good judgments on various arguments concerning the affairs of daily life.      In short, we study logic to become a good thinker. We want to be able to      evaluate arguments so as to decide whether we should accept a belief, or      support a position, on the basis of the arguments for or against it. </p>    <p>In this class, we will study the basic concepts of logic, examine the      dichotomy between values and facts, and learn to distinguish deduction      from induction. Two formal systems of deduction will be introduced so that      students can master the basics in logic and also be ready for the more      advanced study of symbolic logic. The first one is Categorical Logic. In      it we will learn how to use the Venn Diagram to determine the validity of      categorical syllogisms. In the second system Propositional Logic, we will      learn how to symbolize arguments and use the truth table to determine      their validity. In addition, we will study informal fallacies.</p>    <table border="0">      <tbody valign="top">        <tr>          <td width="25%"><strong>Recommended Preparation</strong></td>          <td>Reading Level 4, English Level 4, Math Level 4<br>          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td width="25%"><strong>Transfer Status</strong></td>          <td>CSU A3</td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td width="25%"><strong>Course Format</strong></td>          <td>Lecture and Discussion</td>        </tr>        <tr valign="top">          <td width="25%"><strong>Objectives/SLO</strong></td>          <td>Upon successful completion of this course, the student will be            able to:            <ol type="A">              <li>Evaluate, analyze and criticize arguments.</li>              <li>Organize beliefs and ideas in an orderly manner.</li>              <li>Distinguish and evaluate deductive and inductive arguments.</li>              <li>Identify and label various informal fallacies.</li>            </ol>          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>    <h2>Textbook</h2>    <p>Wu W. <em>iLogic</em>.

You should bring them to class every time. Be sure to follow      the proper protocols when using these devices in class.</p>    <p>You need to ask permission in advance to take photos or record lectures.      Please follow the proper policies and etiquette.</p>    <p>To access <em>iLogic</em> online and materials posted on Canvas, and to      complete online assignments, you will need to have online access at least      1–2 hours daily.</p>    <p>Utilize the resources listed in Student Support on Canvas. You can ask <a        href="http://www.butte.edu/currentstudents/help_on_campus/help_academic/student_tech_support/index.html">Student
        Technical Support</a> for assistance if you run into difficulties. It is      recommended that if needed, you take mini courses to improve your computer      skills.</p>    <p>It is your responsibility to make sure your computer or device works      properly and has a reliable Internet connection. It is also a good      practice to have a backup plan to avoid missing the deadline due to      computer or Internet problems. <strong>Computer/device glitches or loss        of Internet connection will not be accepted as excuses for making up        assignments.</strong></p>    <h2>Assignments and Assessments</h2>    <h3>Reading Assignments</h3>    <p>The textbooks are to provide basic materials for the subject matter.      Additional readings will be provided on Canvas.</p>    <p>Philosophical texts can be hard to read and difficult to understand. It      is quite common that one needs to read the text several times to fully      grasp its main points. To help yourself gain a better understanding of a      subject, it is paramount that you read the assigned materials before it is      discussed in class or online.</p>    <ul>      <li>Read a section or an article as soon as you can after it is assigned        or recommended.</li>      <li>Take notes and jot down questions while you are reading.</li>      <li>Reread the section or the article at least one more time after the        lecture and discussion to make sure you understand the finer points.</li>      <li>Your reading comprehension will be evaluated via in-class exercises or        essay questions on Canvas. <span style="font-weight: bold;">There is no          make-up for missed online submissions. No </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">paper
          copies will be accepted; neither will late submissions or          resubmissions. </span><br>        If you miss an online assignment, you can make up the missed points        through extra-credit.</li>    </ul>    <h3><span style="font-style: normal;">iLogic</span> Exercises</h3>    <p>After an exercise in <em>iLogic</em> is assigned, you should do the      homework as many times as possible. Doing homework is the most effective      way to prepare for tests. You are encouraged to form study groups and use      online communication tools such as Skype or FaceTime to help each other      with homework.</p>    <ul>      <li>If you miss a class, you should check the calendar on Canvas to find        out if there is an assignment.</li>      <li>Make sure your computer and Internet connection work properly. Avoid        doing the assignment at the last moment so that if computer problems        occur, you would still have enough time to do the homework.</li>      <li>For most exercises in <em>iLogic</em>, you can check your answers        online. <strong>The results are not part of your grade.</strong> You        can practice as many times as you like.</li>      <li>Find out which problems you have difficulty solving and ask questions        during the in-class review.</li>      <li>In-class exercises tend to contain identical problems in the <em>iLogic</em>        exercises to ensure that you have done the homework. <strong>In-class          exercises are part of class participation. There are no make-ups for          missed in-class exercises. </strong>You can make up the lost points        through extra-credit.</li>    </ul>    <h3>Tests</h3>    <p>In-class tests are given periodically to monitor your progress. They      typically contain questions similar to homework problems.</p>    <ul>      <li>There will be 8–10 tests for the semester.</li>      <li>Each test is worth 40–60 points.</li>      <li><strong>There is no make-up for missed tests. The first two missed          tests will be dropped.</strong></li>      <li><strong>If no test is missed, the lowest two tests will be dropped.</strong><br>      </li>      <li>If you miss a class, you should check the calendar on Canvas to see        whether there will be a test in the next class.</li>    </ul>    <h3>Final Exam</h3>    <p>The final exam will cover all the chapters in <em>iLogic</em>. It is      worth 200 points.</p>    <h3>Writing Assignments</h3>    <p>The amount of writing will exceed the 1,500-word requirement. The types      of writing include essay questions and forum discussions. All the writings      are to be submitted on Canvas. <strong>There is no make-up, and no late        submission, resubmission or paper copy will be accepted.</strong></p>    <h4>Essay Questions</h4>    <p>Essay questions are used to assess your comprehension and philosophical      thinking. Your answers are graded on both form and content. You need to      complete and submit the answer by the deadline. </p>    <h4>Canvas Discussions</h4>    <p>We will use Canvas Discussions to foster open and in-depth discussions of      philosophical and religious issues. It’s a great way to apply critical      thinking, share viewpoints and learn from one another.</p>    <h2>Extra-credit</h2>    <h3>Extra-credit Assignments or Activities</h3>    <p>Extra-credit assignments or activities will be announced both in class      and on Canvas. They are optional, but you can earn extra-credit points if      you choose to do the assignment or participate in the activity.</p>    <h3>Extra-credit for Class Attendance</h3>    <p>Please take notice that attendance is not part of your grade, but you can      earn extra-credit points by keeping your absences to a minimum. It is      understandable that sometimes students can’t help but miss a class due to      illness or other reasons. So don’t force yourself to come to the class      when you are sick. Both excused and unexcused absences count toward the      number of absences. You can earn up to 40 points with good attendance.<br>    </p>    <table align="center" width="400px">      <tbody>        <tr>          <th height="50px" width="250px">Number of Absences<br>          </th>          <th height="50px" width="150px">Extra-credit</th>        </tr>        <tr align="center">          <td>0</td>          <td>40 points</td>        </tr>        <tr align="center">          <td>1<br>          </td>          <td>30 points</td>        </tr>        <tr align="center">          <td>2<br>          </td>          <td>20 points</td>        </tr>        <tr align="center">          <td>3<br>          </td>          <td>10 points<br>          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>    <h2>Grading</h2>    <p>It is important that we study for self-improvement and self-fulfillment,      and not just for grades. Your grade is to help you gauge what you have      learned in a course. By letting go of the anxiety about the grade, you      will find studying a subject matter much more enjoyable. As a result, you      are more likely to spend time learning the material and earn a good grade.      Only a hard-earned grade that truly reflects what you have learned can      forge self-confidence.</p>    <p>The purpose of homework, in-class assessments and tests is two-fold:      first, to provide you with feedback on your progress in the course;      second, to provide me with some objective data I can use in establishing      individual final grades. Your final grade will be determined by the      percentage of the total points you earn:</p>    <table align="center" width="300px">      <tbody>        <tr>          <th height="50px" width="150px">Percentage</th>          <th height="50px" width="150px">Grade</th>        </tr>        <tr align="center">          <td>90-100%</td>          <td>A</td>        </tr>        <tr align="center">          <td>80-89%</td>          <td>B</td>        </tr>        <tr align="center">          <td>70-79%</td>          <td>C</td>        </tr>        <tr align="center">          <td>60-69%</td>          <td>D</td>        </tr>        <tr align="center">          <td>below 60%</td>          <td>F</td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>    <p>The scale may be lowered, but will not be raised. You can monitor your      progress and grade percentage on Canvas.</p>    <h2>Cheating and Plagiarism</h2>    <p>Students who cheat or commit plagiarism will receive an F grade for the      assignment or for the course, depending on the seriousness of the offense.      Furthermore, they will be subject to disciplinary action.

We pledge to respect all people regardless of sexuality,      gender identity, ethnicity and religious backgrounds.</p>    <p>The most important guideline to remember is the Golden Rule—Do not do to      the others what you do not want done to yourself. As you are respectful to      your teacher and classmates, they will treat you in the same way. Please      comply with the following etiquette:</p>    <ul>      <li>Always conduct yourself in an appropriate and respectable manner.</li>      <li>Attend to personal needs before coming to class.<br>      </li>      <li>Come to class on time and avoid leaving early or in the middle of a        session.</li>      <li>Respect other people even if you disagree with their views.</li>      <li>Wait for your turn to ask questions or express your viewpoints; do not        chitchat in the classroom.</li>      <li>No food, drink or chewing gum.</li>    </ul>    <p>For student rights and privileges, and grounds for disciplinary action,      see <a title="Academic Policies and Procedures" href="http://www.butte.edu/currentstudents/references/handbooks_and_policies/academic-policies-and-procedures.html"        target="_blank">Academic

        on Campus</a>.</p>    <p>The best way to get help with coursework is to ask questions in class.      People shy away from asking questions because they are afraid of appearing      stupid. It is very likely that if you do not understand something, there      is someone else in the class who is suffering from an identical lack of      understanding. You will be doing your classmates a service by asking      questions.</p>    <p>If something is unclear to you or you are having difficulty learning the      material, please feel free to come to see me during my office hours. If      you cannot meet with me during the regular hours, I will be glad to      schedule an appointment.
