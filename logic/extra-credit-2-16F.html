      <p>México Consul for Economic Affairs, Yúriko L. Garcés Lee, discusses the country’s evolution over the past fifty years showing a country in transformation. The main factor driving this change has been growth in exports, which is now at 17% and accounts for a historic high of $400B. More importantly, the transformation reflects a change in products, with 85% of current exports being manufactured goods. México is living a historic moment. Economic cooperation has led to expansion of renewable (wind) energy production, biotechnology initiatives as well as an increase in study abroad programs.</p>
