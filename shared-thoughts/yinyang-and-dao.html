      <h1><em>Yinyang</em> and <em>Dao</em></h1>
      <h2 style="page-break-after: avoid"><em>Yi Jing</em> (<em>I Ching</em>)</h2>

      <p><em>Yi Jing</em>, the Book of
      Change, was compiled in the early period of the <em>Zhou </em>dynasty
      (1123–221 <span style="font-variant: small-caps">b.c.e.</span>) and was interpreted and commented by Kongzi
      (Confucius, 551–479 <span style="font-variant: small-caps">b.c.e.</span>). It has greatly influenced the Chinese
      worldview and thus is a very important book in Chinese philosophy and
      religions.</p>
      <p>Two important notions in <em>Yi Jing</em> are <em>taiji</em> and <em>yinyang</em>. They constitute the fundamental
      conceptual framework that shapes the Chinese worldview.</p>

      <h2 style="page-break-after: avoid"><em>Taiji</em>
      (<em>Taichi</em>)</h2>

      <p><em>Taiji</em> is the
      primordial reality in which no differentiation has occurred. We can
      visualize it as an endless three dimensional void. As such, it is both
      something and nothing. It can be conceptualized as undifferentiated
      space or universe. It is the origin from which everything becomes
      what it is, and relative to which everything is what it is. In
      addition to its original meaning, <em>taiji</em> is sometimes
      understood as the unity and oneness of reality.</p>

      <h2 style="page-break-after: avoid"><em>Yinyang</em></h2>
      <p><em>Yin</em> and <em>yang</em>
      originate from <em>taiji</em>. In <em>Yi</em> <em>Zhuan</em>, it is
      stated, “<em>Taiji</em> yields two <em>yi</em> (two
      dimensions or ultimate measures).”<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1"
      class="footnote">1</a></sup> When differentiation starts,
      contrasts will emerge as <em>yin</em> and <em>yang</em>. <em>Yin</em> and
      <em>yang</em> are these two dimensions. <em>Yin</em> is symbolized using
      the sign “<span class="yy">⚋</span>”
      and <em>yang</em> with “<span class="yy">⚊</span>”.
      (They can be symbolized with Hindu numerals as 0 and 1.) As a binary
      pair, <em>yin</em> and <em>yang</em> mutually yield and define each
      other, and thus one is meaningless without the other. <em>Yin</em>
      means “that which is not <em>yang</em>” and <em>yang</em> means “that
      which is not <em>yin</em>.” (That is, zero is non-one and one is non-zero.)
      In this way <em>yin</em> and <em>yang</em> can be used to represent the
      contrasts that show different characteristics of reality, or
      different states of being. After the first differentiation, there
      would be exactly two states of reality: one of them <em>yin</em> and
      the other <em>yang</em>. If both states are further differentiated,
      then there would be four states: yin-yin <span class="yy">⚏</span>
      (00), yin-yang <span class="yy">⚍</span> (01)
      yang-yin <span class="yy">⚎</span> (10) and
      yang-yang <span class="yy">⚌</span> (11). If each
      of these four states differentiates further, there would be eight
      states: <span class="yy">☷</span> (000), <span
      class="yy">☳</span>
      (001), <span class="yy">☵</span> (010), <span
      class="yy">☱</span>
      (011), <span class="yy">☶</span> (100), <span
      class="yy">☲</span>
      (101), <span class="yy">☴</span>
      (110), and <span class="yy">☰</span> (111). Here
      we have the eight trigrams. With three additional differentiations,
      we would have sixty-four hexagrams such as <span class="yy">䷊</span>
      and <span class="yy">䷌</span>. This process can
      continue indefinitely.</p>
      <p><span style="float: right; width: 240px;

        <strong>Figure 1</strong> The <em>Yinyang bagua</em> Diagram
      </span>The Chinese people recognize the contrasts in the cosmos as <em>yin</em>
      and <em>yang</em>. For instance, day, warmness, the sun and the male
      are categorized as <em>yang</em> whereas night, coldness, the moon and
      the female are labeled as <em>yin</em>. It is important to notice that
      the attribution of <em>yin</em> or <em>yang</em> does not mean to imply
      that one is better than the other. <em>Yin</em> and <em>yang</em> are
      just a binary pair used to represent the contrasts that show
      different characteristics in the world.</p>
      <p>Reality and changes are then
      comprehended and interpreted in terms of <em>yin</em> and <em>yang</em>.
      Once there is a contrast of <em>yinyang</em>, change becomes possible. After the first
      differentiation, reality is distinguished into <em>yin</em> (0) and
      <em>yang</em> (1). A shift from <em>yin</em> to <em>yang</em>, or from <em>yang</em>
      to <em>yin</em> would be a change. Given more differentiations, there
      would be more states. A change would in general be a shift from a
      given state to a different state. For instance, four seasons can be
      designated as follows: spring (01), summer (11), autumn (10) and
      winter (00). The change of season from spring to summer can be
      represented as a change from <em>yin</em>-<em>yang</em> (01) to <em>yang</em>-<em>yang</em>
      (11). Such a change is characterized as the rise or strengthening of
      <em>yang</em> and the corresponding decline or weakening of <em>yin</em>.
      Since <em>yang</em> is also associated with warmness, the rise of <em>yang</em>
      fits well with the observation that it gets warmer from spring to
      summer. This approach can be generalized to explain all changes as
      the rise and decline of <em>yin</em> and <em>yang</em>.</p>

      <h2><em>Yinyang</em> and Harmony</h2>

      <p>The idea of <em>yinyang</em>
      leads the Chinese people to adopt a dynamic worldview that centers on
      harmony. Changes are accepted as the norm of reality. The harmony
      achieved by the <em>dynamic</em> balance of <em>yin</em> and <em>yang</em>
      is viewed as good, and the <em>dynamic</em> unbalance of <em>yin</em> and
      <em>yang</em> as bad. As a binary, <em>yin</em> and <em>yang</em> are
      mutually dependent of each other. A long-term dominance of one over
      the other would upset the balance and stifle change. For instance, a
      long-term dominance of warmness and dryness in weather would
      constitute a drought. The focus of the Chinese worldview is to
      understand how changes occur and evolve so as to promote and maintain
      dynamic balance of <em>yin</em> and <em>yang</em>. This is why <em>dao</em>
      is so important in the Chinese worldview. </p>

      <h2 style="page-break-after: avoid"><em>Dao</em> (<em>Tao</em>)</h2>

      <p><span style="float: right; width: 160px;
      height: 240px; border: 0px solid #000000; padding: 0px 16px 24px 24px; background: #ffffff">
        <img src="Dao.png" alt="The Chinese Character Dao"><br><br><br>
        <strong>Figure 2</strong> The Chinese character <em>dao</em>
      </span>
      <em>Dao</em> literally means
      “the road” or “the path.” Being in one place now and later on
      in a different place is a very basic kind of change in every day
      life.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2"
      class="footnote">2</a></sup>
      To go from one place to another one would have to go along a certain
      route.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3"
      class="footnote">3</a></sup>
      The term “<em>dao</em>” is then generalized to mean the way of
      change. Since changes are explicated in terms of <em>yin</em> and <em>yang</em>,
      <em>dao</em> is thus the principle that characterizes the rise and
      decline of <em>yin</em> and <em>yang</em>. The basic idea in the Chinese
      worldview is to understand <em>dao</em> so that one can be in a good
      position to understand and conduct changes. The likelihood of
      achieving and maintaining long term dynamic balance between <em>yin</em>
      and <em>yang</em> can be increased by choosing right courses of action.
      In doing so, harmony can be sustained not only in human society but
      also between humans and nature.</p>
      <p>Properly understood, we can see why the notion <em>dao</em>
      is so central to the Chinese worldview. <em>Dao</em> simply means the
      way of change. Regrettably this basic meaning sometimes got lost in
      various interpretations that mystify <em>dao</em> and dress <em>dao</em>
      in baffling cloaks. Some even turn <em>dao</em> into a supernatural
      force that influences or controls people’s fate. The prevalence of
      divination and fortune-telling in the Chinese culture is rather
      unfortunate. It is a symptom resulting from a lack of in-depth
      understanding of the Chinese worldview. The teaching of <em>Yi Jing</em>,
      instead of being properly understood to promote harmony, has been
      turned into a system of divination for personal ascendancy and
      fortune.</p>
      <p>Understanding the connection between <em>dao</em>
      and harmony, and their places in the Chinese worldview put us in a
      better position to understand Confucianism and Daoism. Both schools
      of philosophy aim to know <em>dao</em> so as to comprehend changes and
      promote harmony. But they differ on how <em>dao</em> can be known and
      how harmony can be achieved and sustained.</p>

      <h2 style="page-break-after: avoid">The
      Characteristics of the Chinese Worldview</h2>

      <p>Grounded on the framework of
      <em>yin</em> and <em>yang</em>, the Chinese worldview seeks to achieve
      and maintain harmony by means of knowing <em>dao</em>. As a result, it
      has five characteristics that make it stand out as a major
      worldview.</p>
      <p>First of all, the main focus of the Chinese
      worldview is harmony. Harmony is regarded as good while disharmony,
      bad. Notice that the contrast is between good and bad, not good and
      evil. This distinction is important. Even though disharmony is viewed
      as bad, it is understood and accepted as something that is a matter
      of course and would occur from time to time. So the goal is to
      minimize or shorten disharmony, not to eliminate it. This is different
      from some worldviews that center on good and evil, and seek to
      eliminate evil. Also, unlike many other traditions, the Chinese
      worldview does not postulate some supernatural beings or higher power
      to represent good or evil.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4"
      class="footnote">4</a></sup></p>
      <p>Secondly, changes in reality and in life are
      accepted as a matter of course; they are not regarded as bad or
      undesirable. Reality is perceived as dynamic, and not static. This
      provides a philosophical foundation for a progressive outlook.
      Instead of trying to keep the status quo, one would work to guide
      changes in ways that are conducive to harmony.</p>
      <p>Thirdly, virtues and vices are understood in terms
      of the dynamic balance or unbalance between <em>yin</em> and <em>yang</em>.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5"
      class="footnote">5</a></sup>
      The dominance of one over the other for a prolonged period of time,
      or on too many occasions, would be bad. For instance, it would be
      impetuous for a person to rush to act most of the time. On the other
      hand, it is also undesirable to be overly cautious and indecisive. An
      ideal person would be prudent, but capable of acting quickly when
      necessary.</p>
      <p>The fourth characteristic of the Chinese worldview
      is its emphasis on harmony and cooperation, not conflict and
      competition. It embraces the way of harmony and rejects the way of
      domination. Applied to gender issues, this means that the talk of the
      war between men and women would be found distasteful in the Chinese
      worldview. The long-term domination of men over women, or women over
      men, would be bad. Instead, the harmony in a household is to be
      achieved by the mutual respect and cooperation between the couple.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6"
      class="footnote">6</a></sup></p>
      <p>The last but distinctive feature of the Chinese
      worldview is its focus on living a good life in the present life. The
      concern is not on the other world and afterlife such as Heaven or
      rebirth. It does not assume that there is an afterlife and regard the
      present life as somehow secondary to the next life. Rather, it
      accepts that this life is finite and encourages the outlook of living
      the present life to the fullest.</p>
      <p>Understanding <em>yinyang</em> and <em>dao</em> helps
      us gain an overall picture of the Chinese worldview with its goal of
      achieving harmony within human society and between humans and nature.
      Such an understanding also gives us a head start in learning about
      Confucianism and Daoism. Both of them subscribe to this worldview;
      they differ only in how such an ideal should be implemented.</p>

          <p>The contrast and the mutual dependency between <em>yin</em> and

          problem of evil. “Evil exists and cannot be eliminated because good
          cannot exist without evil, just like <em>yin</em> cannot be without
          <em>yang</em>.” But such a view is a misapplication of
          <em>yinyang</em> and also goes against the traditional
          teachings of Judaism and Christianity. If good cannot exist without
