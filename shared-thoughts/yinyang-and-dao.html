    <p class="first"><em>Yinyang</em> (<span class="tc">陰陽，</span><span class="sc">阴阳</span>) and <em>dao</em> (<em>tao</em>, <span class="tc">道</span>) are two of the most important concepts in the Chinese culture and philosophy. They constitute the fundamental conceptual framework that shapes the Chinese worldview.</p>
    <h2 style="page-break-after: avoid" id="taiji-and-yinyang"><em>Taiji</em> and <em>Yinyang</em></h2>
    <p>To understand these two concepts, we need to start with another important concept <em>taiji</em> (<em>taichi</em>, <span class="tc">太極，</span><span class="sc">太极</span>). <em>Yi Jing</em> (<em>I Ching</em>, <span class="tc">易經，</span><span class="sc">易经</span>), the Book of Changes, is an ancient Chinese scripture that focuses on the study of changes. In <em>Yi Jing Xici</em> it is stated that “<em>taiji</em> yields, or gives rise to, two <em>yi</em> (<span class="tc">儀，</span><span class="sc">仪</span>); two <em>yi</em> yield four <em>xiang</em> (<span class="tc">象</span>); four <em>xiang</em> yield eight <em>gua</em> (<span class="tc">卦</span>).”<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup></p>
    <p><em>Taiji</em> is the primordial reality in which no differentiation has occurred. We can visualize it as an endless, undifferentiated space or void. As such, it is both something and nothing. It is something because it is <em>that which is</em>. It is nothing because before differentiation it cannot be said that there is <em>this</em> and there is <em>that</em>.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup> It is the unity and oneness of reality. It is that from which everything becomes what it is.</p>
    <p><em>Yin</em> and <em>yang</em> originate from <em>taiji</em>. “<em>Taiji</em> yields two <em>yi</em>.” These two <em>yi</em> are <em>yin</em> and <em>yang</em>. When differentiation starts, contrasts will emerge as <em>yin</em> and <em>yang</em>. <em>Yin</em> and <em>yang</em> form a binary pair. <em>Yin</em> means “that which is not <em>yang</em>” and <em>yang</em> means “that which is not <em>yin</em>.” As soon as there is <em>yin</em>, there is <em>yang</em>. There cannot be <em>yin</em> without <em>yang</em>, and <em>yang</em> without <em>yin</em>. To illustrate this, we can construe <em>yin</em> and <em>yang</em> as <em>this</em> and <em>that</em>. <em>This</em> is “that which is not <em>that</em>”, and <em>that</em> is “that which is not <em>this</em>.” When there is <em>this</em>, that which is not <em>this</em> would be <em>that</em>. There is no <em>this</em> without <em>that</em>, and no <em>that</em> without <em>this</em>.</p>
    <p>As a binary, <em>yin</em> is symbolized using the sign “<span class="yy">⚋</span>” and <em>yang</em> with “<span class="yy">⚊</span>”. (They can be symbolized with the Hindu-Arabic numerals as 0 and 1. 0 is non-1 and 1 is non-0.) The symbols can then be used to represent the contrasts that we recognize as different characteristics or states of reality. After the first differentiation, reality would be divided into two parts or two states: one of them <em>yin</em> <span class="yy">⚋</span> (0) and the other <em>yang</em> <span class="yy">⚊</span> (1). If each of the two are further differentiated, then there would be four parts or four states (four <em>xiang</em>): <em>yin-yin</em> <span class="yy">⚏</span> (00), <em>yin-yang</em> <span class="yy">⚍</span> (01) <em>yang-yin</em> <span class="yy">⚎</span> (10) and <em>yang-yang</em> <span class="yy">⚌</span> (11). If each of these four differentiates one more time, there would be eight (eight <em>qua</em>): <span class="yy">☷</span> (000), <span class="yy">☳</span> (001), <span class="yy">☵</span> (010), <span class="yy">☱</span> (011), <span class="yy">☶</span> (100), <span class="yy">☲</span> (101), <span class="yy">☴</span> (110), and <span class="yy">☰</span> (111). Here we have the eight trigrams. With three additional differentiations, we would have sixty-four hexagrams such as <span class="yy">䷊</span> and <span class="yy">䷌</span>. This process can continue indefinitely.</p>
    <p><span style="position: relative; float: right; display: flex; flex-direction: column; width: 200px; height: 300px; padding: 24px 16px 24px 24px; background: transparent"><img src="yinyang-baqua.png" style="width: 200px; height: 200px; margin-top: 24px;" alt="Yinyang Bagua Diagram" /> <span style="margin-top: 24px;"><span style="font-weight: 600;">Figure 1</span> The <em>Yinyang-bagua</em> Diagram</span></span> With this schema, the Chinese people categorize the contrasts in the cosmos as <em>yin</em> and <em>yang</em>. Some common examples of <em>yinyang</em> pairs are day/night, sun/moon, hot/cold, summer/winter, fire/water, and male/female. It cannot be stressed enough that the designation of <em>yin</em> or <em>yang</em> in no way implies that one is better than the other. It would be silly to maintain that day is better than night or fire is superior to water. <em>Yin</em> and <em>yang</em> are just a binary pair used to represent the contrasts that show different characteristics in the world. <em>Alas</em>, over time, a tendency toward favoring <em>yang</em> over <em>yin</em> germinated and sprouted out in the Chinese culture, resulting in unfounded prejudices that foster discrimination. The prejudice against women has caused much suffering in the history of China.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">3</a></sup></p>
    <h2 style="page-break-after: avoid" id="without-yinyang-no-change">Without <em>Yinyang</em>, No Changes</h2>
    <p>The very concept of change presupposes the existence of differences. To say that a change occurs means that a shift from <em>this</em> to <em>that</em>, or from <em>that</em> to <em>this</em>, takes place. If <em>this</em> stays as <em>this</em>, then there would be no change. Moreover, there cannot be a binary of <em>this</em> and <em>that</em> without a differentiation. The essential meaning of <em>yinyang</em> is differentiation and contrast. So we can sum up the important point so far this way: without <em>yinyang</em>, there would be no changes. Once there is a contrast of <em>yin</em> and <em>yang</em>, changes become possible. We can now see why <em>yinyang</em> is such a key concept in the Book of Changes, <em>Yi Jing</em>. After the first differentiation, reality is distinguished into <em>yin</em> (<span class="yy">⚋</span>, 0) and <em>yang</em> (<span class="yy">⚊</span>,&nbsp;1). A shift from <em>yin</em> to <em>yang</em>, or from <em>yang</em> to <em>yin</em>, would be a change. Given more differentiations, there would be more states. A change would in general be a shift from a given state to a different state. For instance, four seasons can be designated as follows: spring (<span class="yy">⚍</span>, 01), summer (<span class="yy">⚌</span>, 11), autumn (<span class="yy">⚎</span>, 10) and winter (<span class="yy">⚏</span>, 00). The change of season from spring to summer can then be represented as a change from <em>yin-yang</em> (<span class="yy">⚍</span>, 01) to <em>yang-yang</em> (<span class="yy">⚌</span>, 11). Such a change is characterized as the waxing, or strengthening, of <em>yang</em> and the corresponding waning, or weakening, of <em>yin</em>. Since <em>yang</em> is also associated with warmth, the rise of <em>yang</em> fits well with the observation that it gets warmer from spring to summer. This approach can be generalized to characterize all changes as the rise and fall of <em>yin</em> and <em>yang</em>.</p>
    <h2 style="page-break-after: avoid" id="yinyang-and-harmony"><em>Yinyang</em> and Harmony</h2>
    <p>The Chinese worldview shaped by <em>Yi Jing</em> sees reality as dynamic and not static. Changes are accepted as the way reality is and understood as the interplay between <em>yin</em> and <em>yang</em>. As a binary, <em>yin</em> and <em>yang</em> coexist and must accompany each other. Without <em>yin</em>, there is no <em>yang</em>, and without <em>yang</em>, there is no <em>yin</em>. When <em>yang</em> is getting stronger, there would be a corresponding weakening of <em>yin</em>, and vice versa. To use the change of day and night as an example, around midnight, <em>yin</em> is at its highest point and <em>yang</em> its lowest. Henceforward, <em>yang</em> would be rising and <em>yin</em> falling. At dawn, <em>yin</em> and <em>yang</em> are at an equilibrium. <em>Yang</em> would continue to strengthen and reach its peak around noon, but then start to weaken. At dusk, the two would reach another equilibrium. This waxing and waning of <em>yin</em> and <em>yang</em> throughout twenty four hours of the day is regarded as an example of a <em>dynamic</em> balance of <em>yin</em> and <em>yang</em>.</p>
    <p>Now imagine that for some unknown causes and conditions, daylight persists for twenty four hours. There is no dusk, night and dawn, and the whole day is just like noon. The change of day and night is disrupted. Using the language of <em>Yi Jing</em>, we would <em>describe</em> this bizarre phenomenon as <em>yang</em> staying at its fullest strength for twenty-four hours.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote">4</a></sup> Such a disruption is regarded as a disharmony, a breakdown of the <em>dynamic</em> balance between <em>yin</em> and <em>yang</em>.</p>
    <p>Likewise, floods and droughts are examples of disharmony. In contrast, the normal change of day and night and the change of seasons are taken to be examples of harmony, viewed as the <em>dynamic</em> balance of <em>yin</em> and <em>yang</em>. The focus of <em>Yi Jing</em> and the Chinese worldview is to study and understand how changes occur and evolve so as to maintain harmony and avoid disharmony. This is why <em>dao</em> is another important concept in the Chinese worldview.</p>
    <h2 style="page-break-after: avoid" id="dao-tao"><em>Dao</em> (<em>Tao</em>)</h2>
    <p><span style="position: relative; float: right; display: flex; flex-direction: column; width: 200px; height: 280px; padding: 0px 16px 24px 24px; background: transparent;"><img src="dao.png" style="width: 180px; height: 180px; margin-top: 12px;" alt="The Chinese Character Dao" /> <span style="margin-top: 24px;"><span style="font-weight: 600;">Figure 2</span> The Chinese Character <em>Dao</em></span></span> In a weekday when we go from home to school or work, a change of location takes place. To go from one place to another you would have to follow a road, and the route you take is how the change from being home to being at school or work takes place.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote">5</a></sup> The Chinese character “dao” literally means “the road” or “the path.” The term “dao” is then generalized to mean <em>the way of changes</em>. Since changes are characterized and interpreted in terms of the interplay between <em>yin</em> and <em>yang</em>, <em>dao</em> is thus the principle that formulates the waxing and waning of <em>yin</em> and <em>yang</em>. The focus of the Chinese worldview is to achieve and maintain harmony. This is why studying <em>dao</em> becomes the central intellectual pursuit in the Chinese culture. The goal is to learn <em>dao</em> so that changes can be understood, managed, and guided to achieve and sustain harmony not only in human society but also between humans and nature.</p>
    <p>Regrettably this fundamental meaning of <em>dao</em> got obscured over time in the history of China. Many schools of thoughts advocated various interpretations that mystify <em>dao</em> and dress <em>dao</em> in baffling cloaks. Some even turn <em>dao</em> into a supernatural force that influences or controls nature and people’s lives. The prevalence of divination and fortune-telling in the Chinese culture is rather unfortunate. It is a symptom resulting from a lack of in-depth understanding of <em>yinyang</em> and <em>dao</em>. The teaching of <em>Yi Jing</em>, instead of being properly studied and understood to promote harmony, has been turned into systems of divination for personal gains and ascendancy.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote">6</a></sup> If a fortune-teller foretells that there is no divorce in your future, does it mean that your marriage is guaranteed to last no matter what you do from now on? What if then you, wrongheadedly thinking your marriage is secured, mistreat your significant other and have affairs with others? Is your marriage still going to last? Even if it does, will it be a happy marriage? Seeking assurance from a fortune-teller is simply wishful thinking. The right way to a good marriage is to learn the <em>dao</em> of marriage and work on the relationship everyday to forge the bond.</p>
    <h2 style="page-break-after: avoid" id="the-characteristics-of-the-chinese-worldview">The Characteristics of the Chinese Worldview</h2>
    <p>Grounded on the framework of <em>yin</em> and <em>yang</em>, the Chinese worldview seeks to achieve and maintain harmony by means of knowing <em>dao</em>. As a result, it has five characteristics that make it stand out as a major worldview.</p>
    <h3 style="page-break-after: avoid" id="the-emphasis-on-harmony">The Emphasis on Harmony</h3>
    <p>First of all, the main concern of the Chinese worldview is harmony. Harmony is regarded as good while disharmony, bad. Notice that the contrast is between good and bad, not good and evil. This distinction is important. Even though disharmony is viewed as bad, it is understood and accepted as something that will occur from time to time. So the goal is to minimize or shorten disharmony, not to eliminate it. This is different from other worldviews that center on good and evil, and seek to eliminate evil. Moreover, since disharmony is understood as the dynamic imbalance between <em>yin</em> and <em>yang</em>, it is not deemed as evil. In contrast to many western traditions, the Chinese worldview does not postulate some supernatural beings or higher power to represent good or evil.<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote">7</a></sup></p>
    <h3 style="page-break-after: avoid" id="the-progressive-outlook">The Progressive Outlook</h3>
    <p>Second, changes in reality and in life are accepted as inevitable, and not regarded as bad or undesirable. Reality is perceived as dynamic, and not static. It would be misguided and futile to try to stop changes. Instead of keeping the status quo, one should study <em>dao</em> and find ways to guide changes to achieve harmony. This provides a philosophical footing for the progressive outlook.</p>
    <h3 style="page-break-after: avoid" id="the-middle-way">The Middle Way</h3>
    <p>Third, virtues and vices are understood in terms of the dynamic balance or imbalance between <em>yin</em> and <em>yang</em>.<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote">8</a></sup> The dominance of one over the other for a prolonged period of time, or on too many occasions, would be regarded as bad. For instance, a person would be impetuous if she rushes to act most of the time. On the other hand, it is also less than ideal if a person is overly cautious and indecisive. A person with the trait of being prudent, but capable of acting quickly when necessary would be praised as virtuous.</p>
    <h3 style="page-break-after: avoid" id="Cooperation-Over-Competition">Cooperation Over Competition</h3>
    <p>The fourth characteristic of the Chinese worldview is to promote cooperation and shun conflict and competition. It embraces the way of <em>ren</em> and harmony (<em>rendao</em>, <span class="tc">仁道</span>) and rejects the way of domination and bullying (<em>badao</em>, <span class="tc">霸道</span>). Applied to gender equality, this means that the talk of the war between men and women would be found distasteful in the Chinese worldview. The long-term domination of men over women, or women over men, would be bad. Instead, the harmony in a household is to be achieved by the mutual respect and cooperation between the couple.</p>
    <h3 style="page-break-after: avoid" id="the-focus-on-the-present-life">The Focus on the Present Life</h3>
    <p>The last distinctive feature of the Chinese worldview is its focus on living a good life in the present life. The concern is not on the afterlife such as Heaven or rebirth. It does not assume the existence of an afterlife<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote">9</a></sup> and regard the present life as somehow secondary to the next life. Rather, it accepts that this life is finite and encourages the outlook of living the present life to the fullest.</p>
    <p>These five characteristics set the Chinese worldview apart from others. They result from the conceptual framework of <em>yinyang</em> and <em>dao</em>, laid down and set forth in <em>Yi Jing</em>. Many schools of thoughts in the Chinese tradition aim to know <em>dao</em> so as to comprehend changes and promote harmony. They differ mainly on how <em>dao</em> can be known and how harmony can be achieved and sustained. The two most prominent schools, Confucianism (<em>rujia</em>, <span class="tc">儒家</span>) and Daoism (<em>daojia</em>, <span class="tc">道家</span>), share these outlooks and ideals, but advocate different ways of learning <em>dao</em> and achieving harmony. The proper understanding of <em>yinyang</em> and <em>dao</em> gives us a head start in studying their teachings.</p>

          <p>If <em>yin</em> and <em>yang</em> are supposed to be equal, then what accounts for China being a male-dominant society? The causes lie more on China being an agrarian country for thousands of years and its needs to defend itself against nomadic tribes than on philosophical or religious grounds. It is telling that the Chinese character for man or the male, <em>nan</em> (<span class="tc">男</span>), is composed of two Chinese characters: <em>tian</em> (<span class="tc">田</span>) and <em>li</em> (<span class="tc">力</span>).

          <p>The contrast and the mutual dependency between <em>yin</em> and <em>yang</em> are sometimes mistakenly used as a response to the problem of evil: Evil exists and cannot be eliminated because just like <em>yin</em> cannot exist alone without <em>yang</em>, good cannot exist without evil. However, such a contention is a misapplication of <em>yinyang</em>. It would be an error to say that good is <em>yin</em> and evil is <em>yang</em>, or good is <em>yang</em> and evil is <em>yin</em>. More seriously, such a response would not sit well with certain Christian theologies, for if good cannot exist without evil, does this mean that God cannot exist without the Devil? <a href="#fnref:7" class="reversefootnote">↩︎</a></p>

          <p>This framework of <em>yinyang</em> balance is also adopted in many other domains such as health and medicine. In Chinese medicine, an illness is often <em>characterized</em> as an imbalance between <em>yin</em> and <em>yang</em>. Again, it is worth reiterating that it would be a mistake to say that the illness is <em>caused</em> by an imbalance between <em>yin</em> and <em>yang</em>. <a href="#fnref:8" class="reversefootnote">↩︎</a></p>
