      <p class="first" style="margin-top: 48px">The term &ldquo;karma&rdquo; literally
        means &ldquo;deeds,&rdquo; and has become a commonly used word even among people who are not
        Hindus or Buddhists. Clich&eacute;s such as &ldquo;You reap what you sow&rdquo; and &ldquo;What goes
        around comes around&rdquo; are often cited to explain karma, but they capture only a
        fragment of what the idea of karma is meant to teach in these two spiritual
        traditions. To gain a more complete and deeper understanding of karma, we need
        to study it against the background of the Hindu history. After all, it is an
        idea first developed in Hinduism.</p>
      <p>After the Aryan people entered the India subcontinent, they set up the
        Caste system to consolidate their rule over the indigenous people in the
        Indus Valley. The rigid and unjust system caused tremendous suffering among
        people in the lower castes. Had you been born as a member of the lower
        castes, or worse, as an untouchable, not only would you have had a hard
        life, but your children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren would also
        have been members of the same caste or outcastes with no hope to improve
        their lot. What would you have done if you had found yourself born into such
        a bondage? Would you have been willing to just accept your fate and toil all
        your life for a meager subsistence?</p>
      <p>We can imagine the agony and wretchedness of such a life due to despair.
        There would be no hope that things would get better for you and your
        offspring. Thus, it is quite understandable that Hindus would turn to
        religion to find a way out. There is truth in the aphorism that religion
        gives people hope. One way to understand various spiritual traditions and
        religions is to see how they help their followers answer basic questions,
        address common concerns and cope with hardships in life.<sup id="fnref:1">
        <a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup></p>
      <p>By looking into how the idea of karma and the belief in rebirth helped
        people of the lower classes cope with the injustice and brutality of the
        caste system, we can gain a deeper appreciation of their significance in the
        Indian spiritual traditions. Prima facie they seem to give Hindus hope to
        escape the iron grip of the caste system through good karma, which would
        allegedly lead to a rebirth into a higher caste. The doctrine of how karma
        affects rebirths also seems to provide an explanation of why people are born
        into different castes. It is claimed that people are born into lower castes
        because of bad karma from previous lives. In additional to providing an
        explanation, the belief that bad people will be punished in the next life
        can also serve as a deterrent by drilling fear into people&rsquo;s hearts so that
        they dare not transgress.</p>
      <p>However, karma, understood this way, would become an idea that sustains the
        unjust caste system. By telling members of lower castes to place their hope in
        the next life, it weakens their motivation to challenge and eliminate the
        inhumane and cruel system. It also camouflages the fact that the caste system
        was what caused people in the lower castes to yearn for the escape from its iron
        grip in the first place.</p>
      <p>The fishy stench of such an account gets stronger when it attempts to
        explain away the inequality in terms of karma from the previous life. If
        you were an untouchable under the caste system, it would not be surprising
        that the question
        of &ldquo;Why me?&rdquo; would cross your mind at some time or another. Why would you be
        born as an untouchable while others were born as princes or princesses? Instead
        of acknowledging that the case system is blatantly unfair, such a
        pseudo-explanation amounts to an in-your-face shout &ldquo;It all your own faults! You
        deserve it!&rdquo; So instead of questioning the legitimacy of the caste system and
        fighting against its injustice and cruelty, people in the lower castes were
        taught to put blame on their bad karma from their previous lives and
        accept their lot as punishments. If they wanted to better their next
        lives, then they should slave away their lives to accumulate good
        karma.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup></p>
      <p>This shows how the teachings of karma and rebirth can be hijacked and misused
        to solidify the power and privileges of the upper classes. Beliefs in karma and
        rebirth can be twisted to convince members of the lower castes to stay put in
        their stations of life and place their hope in the next life. This way, the
        ruling classes can minimize the likelihood of an uprising. Religions can give
        people hope and inspire people to strive for a better future, but they can also
        be turned into a powerful system of reward and punishment to control people and
        keep them subjugated.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3"
        class="footnote">3</a></sup></p>
      <p>The view that good karma will result in a higher rebirth and bad karma, a
        lower rebirth should be rejected not only for the ploy to maintain the
        status quo and the detestable stance that the lower castes and the outcastes
        deserve their lot, but more importantly for its incoherence with the overall
        Hindu teachings.</p>
      <p>First of all, rebirth according to both Hinduism and Buddhism is not
        the transmigration of an individual soul from body to body. The
        transmigration view presupposes a metaphysical dualism that claims that a
        person consists of a physical body and a non-physical soul.<sup
        id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote">4</a></sup> Upon death, a
        person&rsquo;s soul would leave the body. Later on, the soul would enter a
        new body and result in the rebirth of the person. But this is not what
        rebirth is according to Hinduism and Buddhism.</p>
      <p>In Hinduism, a person, together with every other maya<sup id="fnref:5">
        <a href="#fn:5" class="footnote">5</a></sup> in the cosmos, is an
        appearance of Brahman (the Hindu term for the divine). Since we humans are
        appearances of Brahman, Brahman is what each of us truly is. Your
        atman&mdash;your true self&mdash;is Brahman.<sup id="fnref:6"><a
        href="#fn:6" class="footnote">6</a></sup> A person&rsquo;s birth is the
        beginning of Brahman appearing as he, and his death is the end of such an
        appearance. Once Brahman ceases to appear as a particular person, that
        person would cease to exist. Brahman may appear in the future as someone
        very similar to that person, but it is not the same person returning to
        live another life. Rather, it is Brahman that is reborn (that is,
        reappears).<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote">7</a></sup>
        Since Brahman is what the person truly is, in this sense it can be said
        that the person is reborn.</p>
      <p>The Buddhist view on rebirth differs from the Hindu&rsquo;s. Buddhism
        refrains from metaphysical speculations and avoids asserting the existence
        of Brahman. Instead, it focuses on the impermanence of the world and the
        dependent arising (or interacting) of karma. As a result, Buddhism
        counsels us not to see each other as individual beings. Instead, we should
        learn to recognize the interbeing (a term coined by Thich Nhat Hanh) of
        all. Rebirth then is understood as the continuation of karma. Since we are
        what we do, a person&rsquo;s karma (legacy) can be emulated and carried on
        by others in the future. These future patterns of karma would be
        &ldquo;his&rdquo; rebirth. </p> <p>It is worth pointing out that the
        popular saying &ldquo;Good karma leads to good rebirths&rdquo; is still
        correct and should be understood properly under both Indian traditions. In
        both Hinduism and Buddhism, a person is reborn when his good karma
        inspires and gives rise to new manifestations of such a legacy.<sup
        id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote">8</a></sup> What should be
        rejected is the view that a person with good karma will return in the next
        life as the same person and live a good life as the reward.</p>
      <p>The second reason for rejecting the popular but mistaken view that karma
        determines one&rsquo;s rebirth is that such a view is very tunnel-visioned in seeing
        everything in terms of reward and punishment. It turns the spiritual teaching of
        karma into a scrooge&rsquo;s obsession in calculating his spiritual, moral debts and
        credits, with the impure, self-serving motivation of avoiding punishment and
        getting reward. This distorted view leads many people to think of karma in terms
        of the worn-out saying &ldquo;What goes around comes around.&rdquo; This kind of thinking
        can suffocate one&rsquo;s spiritual growth. Instead of being inspired and empowered to be more prudent,
        considerate and caring, a person is consumed with constant anxiety over his
        individual sum of karma, and the fear of bad karma catching up with him. It is
        clear that such a view does not sit well with Hinduism and Buddhism. Both aim to
        inspire people to be selfless and transcend the worldly concern of reward and
        punishment. </p>
      <p>The third reason why the what-goes-around-comes-around view
        of karma is inadequate and misleading is that it is too individualistic, and
        goes against an important insight in the teaching of karma&mdash;one&rsquo;s intentions and
        deeds affect not only oneself but also other people. Accounting for a person&rsquo;s
        fortune or misfortune solely in terms of what he did in the past has at least
        two shortcomings. First of all, this would make it seem as if my karma has
        effects only on me. This may lead us into thinking that what I do affects only
        myself, so I can do whatever I want in life; after all, it is my life.
        Consequently, it would promote self-centeredness. Second, such an
        individualistic explanation leaves out how other people&rsquo;s karma affects a
        person, and hence is incomplete. A more comprehensive causal explanation of why
        someone were born into slavery in the Hindu Caste system has to take into
        account many things other people did before his birth: the deeds of the Aryan
        people who set up the system, the deeds of slave masters who continue to uphold
        the unjust system, the life of his parents, and so on.<sup
        id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote">9</a></sup></p>
      <p>Some may complain that such a causal account does not address the issue
        of fairness. It does not answer the &ldquo;Why me?&rdquo; and &ldquo;Why
        not me?&rdquo; questions. It does not explain how comes I was not born as
        a prince or a prodigy.<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10"
        class="footnote">10</a></sup></p>
      <p>However, such a complaint begs the question. It presupposes that if I did not
        do anything to deserve it, then it is unfair for me to be born as a slave while
        another person was born as a prince. But this is exactly the wrong kind of
        thinking, namely, the individualistic, blame-the-victim mentality, the Hindu
        teaching of karma is meant to help us overcome.</p>
      <p>Instead, you were who you were at birth because you were your parents&rsquo; child,
        and you were born into a certain family, area, society and culture at a certain
        time in history. Your parents&rsquo; genes and what they and other people did before
        your birth affected you in one way or another, and contributed to the physical
        and mental conditions, what kind of family and socio-economic class you were
        born into. So whether you were born healthy, into a good family with loving
        parents or not is beyond your control and should not be seen as somehow a result
        of your own doing.</p>
      <p>We should not accept an understanding of karma that promotes the
        it&rsquo;s-all-your-own-fault mindset just to satisfy our demand of fairness based on
        the crude conception that all is fair if everyone gets what he deserves.</p>
      <p>Indeed, it is unfair if some are born as princes and princesses while others
        are born as slaves. A person born as a prince cannot in good conscience use the
        superficial understanding of karma to justify his being born as a prince and
        others being born as his servants and maids, thinking that everyone deserves his
        or her lot due to past karma. Rather, if he is spiritual, he may want to change
        the socio-political system into a more equitable one.</p>
      <p>It is also unfair that some are born with talents and others, disabilities.
        Realizing this, a spiritual person would shun using his advantages as a head
        start in life. Instead, he would commit himself to serve others.</p>
      <p>The questions of &ldquo;Why me?&rdquo; and &ldquo;Why not me?&rdquo;
        arise also because we see each other as individuals. When we compare
        individual lives and notice the inequality, we demand an answer of why
        some people seem to be better off than others. In Hinduism, the teaching
        of &ldquo;We are Brahman&rdquo; aims to inspire us to see spiritually that
        we are one and share one life together&mdash;in the sense that <em>we are
          willing to take other people&rsquo;s joy as our joy and their suffering as our
          suffering</em>. In this way, the seeming inequality in life dissolves in the ocean of
        love. When we all have the same life, how can life be unfair?</p>
      <p>Many may find this totally absurd. They would cry out loud, &ldquo;What are you
        talking about? How can we all have the same life? I don&rsquo;t feel what others
        feel.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>But not being able to or not wanting to feel what others feel is exactly
        where the difficulty lies. We cannot feel others&rsquo; feeling because we are more or
        less self-centered. Self-centeredness blinds us and blocks our empathy. It is
        only through the expansion of empathy can we feel what others feel, and merge
        our lives with their lives. This is why there cannot be compassion without
        empathy.</p>
      <p>The teaching of karma is really fairly simple, straightforward and
        commonsensical. It says that our intentions and deeds affect us and other
        people, so we should nourish good wills and do our best to make everyone&rsquo;s life
        better. It is in this way the idea of karma in Hinduism and Buddhism promotes
        universal, spiritual love, and is a key part of these two spiritual traditions.
        Karma is not some mysterious metaphysical, or supernatural, force or power that
        somehow comes back to haunt you. Karma is simply what we do. Learning to do
        better is just part of growing up. And growing up is just life.</p>
