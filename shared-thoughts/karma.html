      <p class="first" style="margin-top: 48px">The term “karma”
      literally means “deeds,” and has become a commonly used word
      even among people who are not Hindus or Buddhists. Clichés such as
      “You reap what you sow” and “What goes around comes
      around” are often repeated to explain karma, but they capture only a
      fragment of what the idea of karma is meant to teach in Hindu and
      Buddha <em>dharma</em>. To gain a more complete and deeper
      understanding of karma, we need to study it against the background of the
      Hindu history. After all, it is an idea first developed in India.</p>
      <h2 style="page-break-after: avoid"
      id="karma-rebirth-and-the-caste-system">Karma, Rebirth and the Caste
      System</h2>
      <p>After the Aryan people migrated to the India subcontinent, they set up
      the Caste system to consolidate their rule over the indigenous people in
      the Indus Valley. The rigid and unjust system caused tremendous suffering
      among people in the lower castes. Had you been born as a member of the
      lower castes or, worse, as an untouchable, not only would you have had a
      hard life, but your children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren would
      also have been members of the same caste or outcaste with no hope of
      improving their lot. It would be no surprise that the question of “Why me?”
      would cross your mind at some point in time. Wondering why you were born
      as an untouchable while others were born as princes or princesses would
      fill you with anguish and fury. What would you do if you found yourself
      born into such a bondage? Would you be willing to just accept your fate
      and toil all your life for a meager subsistence?</p>
      <p>We can imagine the agony and wretchedness of such a life due to
      despair. There would be no hope that things would get better for you and
      your offspring. Thus, it is quite understandable that Hindus would turn to
      religion to find a way out. There is truth in the aphorism that religion
      gives people hope. One way to understand various spiritual traditions and
      religions is to see how they help their followers answer basic questions,
      address common concerns and cope with hardships in life.<sup id="fnref:1">
      <a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> By looking into how the idea
      of karma and the belief in rebirth helped people of the lower classes cope
      with the injustice and brutality of the Caste system, we can gain a deeper
      appreciation of their significance in the Indian spiritual traditions.</p>
      <p>At first glance, the doctrine of how karma affects rebirths seem to
      give the lower castes and the untouchable hope to escape the iron grip of
      the Caste system through good karma. Allegedly, by accumulating good karma
      in this life one could be reborn into a higher caste in the next life.
      Moreover, it seems to provide an explanation of why people are born into
      different castes. It is claimed that people are born into lower castes
      because of bad karma from previous lives.</p>
      <p>However, this doctrine, widely attributed to the religious teachings of
      India, is a corrupted understanding of karma and rebirth that could be
      used to sustain the unjust Caste system. Hindu dharma is antithetical to
      the blatant unfairness, brutality and cruelty of the Case system.<sup
      id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup> <em>Alas</em>,
      the teaching of karma and rebirth is perverted by such a commonly repeated
      view to justify the status quo and add insult to injury. “You are born
      into a low caste because of your bad karma from the previous life. You
      deserve your lot in this life! It is all your own faults!” So instead of
      questioning the legitimacy of the Caste system and fighting against its
      injustice and cruelty, people in the lower castes were brainwashed into
      putting blame on their bad karma from their previous lives and accept
      their lot as punishment. They were told that if they wanted to have a
      better next life, then they should slave away in this life to accumulate
      good karma.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">3</a></sup>
      By telling members of the lower castes to place their hope in the next
      life, the corrupted teaching weakens their motivation to revolt against
      the cruel and inhumane system. In addition, it masks the fact that the
      Caste system was what casted them into such a miserable lot in the first
      place. Also, the belief that bad people will be punished in the next life
      drills fear into people’s hearts and serves as a deterrent so that they
      dare not rebel. This way, the ruling classes can minimize the likelihood
      of an uprising.</p>
      <p>Religions can give people hope and inspire people to strive for a
      better future, but they can also be turned into a powerful system of
      reward and punishment to control people and keep them subjugated.<sup
      id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote">4</a></sup> The view that
      good karma will result in a higher rebirth and bad karma, a lower one
      should be rejected for three reasons. First, it is perverted to maintain
      the status quo. Second, the stance that the lower castes and the outcastes
      deserve their lot is detestable. Third, and more importantly, it is
      inconsistent with both Hindu and Buddha dharma.</p>
      <h2 style="page-break-after: avoid"
      id="atman-anatta-and-rebirth"><em>Atman</em>, <em>Anatta</em> and
      Rebirth</h2>
      <p>First of all, rebirth according to both Hindu and Buddha dharma is not
      the transmigration of an individual soul from body to body. The
      transmigration view presupposes a metaphysical dualism that claims that a
      person consists of a physical body and a non-physical soul.<sup
      id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote">5</a></sup> Upon death, a
      person’s soul would leave the body. Later on, the soul would enter a
      new body and result in the rebirth of the person. This view is widespread
      and commonly held, but it is not what rebirth really is according to both
      spiritual traditions.</p>
      <p>In Hindu dharma, a person, together with every other <em>maya</em><sup
      id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote">6</a></sup> in the cosmos,
      is an appearance of <em>Brahman</em>. Since we humans are appearances of
      Brahman, Brahman is what each of us truly is. Your <em>atman</em>, i.e.,
      your true self, is Brahman.<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7"
      class="footnote">7</a></sup> A person’s birth is the beginning of Brahman
      appearing as her, a person and maya. Her death is the end of such an
      appearance. Once Brahman ceases to appear as a particular person, that
      person would cease to exist as maya. But her true self, Brahman, would
      continue to exist. Brahman may appear in the future as someone very
      similar to that person, but it is not the same person returning to live
      another life. Rather, <em>it is Brahman that is reborn</em> (that is,
      reappears).<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote">8</a></sup>
      Since Brahman is what a person truly is, in this sense it can be said that
      the person is reborn.</p>
      <p>The Buddhist view on rebirth differs from the Hindu’s. Buddha dharma
      refrains from metaphysical speculations and avoids asserting the existence
      of Brahman. Instead, it focuses on the impermanence of the world and the
      dependent arising (co-conditioning and interacting) of karma. As a result,
      Buddha dharma counsels us not to <em>see</em> each other as individual
      beings. (This is the gist of the teaching of <em>anatta</em>.) Instead, we
      should learn to recognize the interbeing (a term coined by Thich Nhat
      Hanh<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote">9</a></sup>) of
      all. Rebirth then is understood as <em>the continuation of karma</em>. A
      person’s karma is who she is and is constantly reverberating in the ocean
      of karma. Because of dependent arising, her karma can be emulated and
      carried on by others in the future. These future patterns of karma would
      be her rebirth. In this sense, a person who truly embodies the teachings
      of the Buddha would be his rebirth, and a person exemplifies Jesus’
      spirituality would be the reincarnation of Jesus .</p>
      <p>For people who long for a continuing existence after death, these
      proper understandings of rebirth can be a letdown. However, not clinging to
      individual existence is the key to <em>maksha</em> in Hindu dharma and
      <em>nivarna</em> in Buddha dharma. It is also worth pointing out that the
      popular saying “Good karma leads to good rebirths” is nontheless
      correct under these proper understandings. In both Hindu and Buddha
      dharma, a person is reborn when her good karma inspires and gives rise to
      new manifestations of such a legacy.<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10"
      class="footnote">10</a></sup>
      What should be rejected is the view that a person with good karma will
      return in the next life as the <em>same</em> person and live a good life as the
      reward.</p>
      <h2 style="page-break-after: avoid"
      id="transcending-reward-and-punishment">Transcending Reward and
      Punishment</h2>
      <p>The popular view that karma determines whether a person has a good or a
      bad rebirth is at odds with the proper understandings of rebirth. It is
      misguided and should be rebuffed. Another reason for rejecting such a view
      is that its tunnel-vision in seeing everything in terms of reward and
      punishment stifles spiritual growth. It turns the spiritual teaching of
      karma into a scrooge’s obsession with the balance sheet of merits and
      demerits. It taints spiritual pursue with the impure and self-serving
      motivation of avoiding punishment and getting reward. This distorted view
      leads many people to think of karma in terms of the worn-out saying “What
      goes around comes around.” This kind of thinking can suffocate one’s
      spiritual growth. Instead of being inspired and empowered to be more
      prudent, considerate and caring, a person is consumed with constant
      anxiety over her individual sum of karma and the fear of bad karma
      catching up with her. It is clear that such a view does not sit well with
      Hindu and Buddha dharma. Both spiritual traditions aim to inspire people
      to be <em>selfless</em> and transcend the worldly concern of reward and
      punishment.
      </p>
      <p>The what-goes-around-comes-around view of karma is inadequate and
      misguided. It is too individualistic and goes against an important
      insight in the teaching of karma—one’s intentions and deeds affect not
      only oneself but also other people. Accounting for a person’s fortune or
      misfortune solely in terms of what she did in the past has at least two
      shortcomings. First of all, this would make it seem as if my karma has
      effects only on myself. This would lead to the wrongheaded thinking that
      since what I do affects only myself, I can do whatever I want in life.
      After all, it is my life. This mindset would promote self-centeredness.
      Second, such a narrow and individualistic view leaves out how other
      people’s karma affects a person, and hence is lacking in helping us make
      sense of the fortune and misfortune in life. A more comprehensive
      explanation of why someone was born into servitude in the Caste system has
      to take into account many things other people did before her birth such as
      the deeds of the Aryan people who set up the system, the deeds of the
      upper castes who continued to uphold the unjust system, and so on.<sup
      id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote">11</a></sup></p>
      <h2 style="page-break-after: avoid" id="karma-and-fairness-in-life">Karma
      and Fairness in Life</h2>
      <p>Some may object that it is unfair that other people’s deeds impact
      their lives. It does not address the questions of “Why me?” and “Why not
      me?”. It does not settle the unfairness of some people being born with
      disabilities or as slaves while others being born with talents or as
      nobles.<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12"
      class="footnote">12</a></sup></p>
      <p>Indeed, the inequality at birth is unfair. But it is unfair because of
      the value system and the socio-economic structure a person is born into.
      In a world that favors people born with talents, good looks and so on,
      people born with lesser degrees of the desirable traits would suffer
      discrimination. We shouldn’t judge fairness in terms of a person’s merits
      or demerits. Otherwise we would fall into the mind trap that if a person
      gets what she deserves, then all is fair. How could a baby deserve to be
      born blind? Don’t we say that babies are innocent? This individualistic,
      you-deserve-it thinking is exactly the wrong kind of mindset the Hindu
      teaching of karma is meant to help us break away from.</p>
      <p>Instead, you were who you were at birth because you were your parents’
      child, and you were born into a certain family, area, society and culture
      at a certain time in history. Your parents’ genes and what they and other
      people did before your birth affected you one way or another, and
      contributed to the physical and mental conditions, what kind of family and
      socio-economic class you were born into. So whether you were born healthy
      or not, into a good family with loving parents or not, and so on, is
      beyond your control and should not be seen as somehow a result of your own
      doing so that you either deserve or don’t deserve it.</p>
      <p>We should not accept the what-goes-around-comes-around understanding of
      karma. It promotes the it’s-all-your-own-fault mentality and tries to
      satisfy our twisted sense of fairness based on the crude conception that
      all is fair if everyone gets what she deserves.</p>
      <p>A person born as a prince cannot in good conscience uses the
      superficial understanding of karma to justify his privileges and
      entitlements. It is wrong to think that everyone deserves his or her lot
      due to past karma. Rather, if he is spiritual, he would want to reform the
      socio-political system into a more equitable one. It is also unfair that
      some are born with talents and others, disabilities. Realizing this, a
      spiritual person should shun using her advantages for personal gains in
      life. Instead, she should use it to benefit the world and commit her life
      to serve others. Isn’t this what the Buddha, Jesus and Gandhi did in their
      lives?</p>
      <h2 style="page-break-after: avoid"
      id="the-spiritual-teaching-of-karma">The Spiritual Teaching of Karma</h2>
      <p>Another reason the questions of “Why me?” and “Why not me?” arise is we
      see each other as individuals. When we compare individual lives and notice
      the inequality, we tend to demand an answer to why some people seem to be
      better off than others. In Hindu dharma, the teaching of “We are Brahman”
      aims to inspire us to transcend individualism and <em>see spiritually</em>
      that we are one and share one life together. This point is depicted
      movingly in the prison scene in the movie <em>Gandhi</em> when Gandhi
      said to Rev. Charlie Andrews “If I want to be one with them, I have to
      live like them.” The Hindu spiritual teaching can be encapsulated as
      this: <em>Take other people’s joy as our joy and their suffering as our
      suffering</em>. In this way, the inequality in life would dissolve in the
      ocean of love. When we all strive to better each other’s life, life would
      be fairer.</p>
      <p>Many may find the teaching of taking other people’s joy as our joy and
      their suffering as our suffering unfathomable. They would decry “Oh, for
      crying out loud, what are you talking about? With separate consciousness,
      how can one person feel another person’s joy or sorrow. I don’t feel what
      others feel.” or “Why would I do that? I have my own life to deal with.”</p>
      <p>But not being able to or not wanting to feel what others feel is
      exactly where the difficulty and challenge lies. We would rather be numb
      about others’ feeling because we are more or less self-absorbed.
      Self-centeredness blinds us and blocks our empathy. It is only through the
      expansion of empathy can we feel what others feel, and merge our lives
      with their lives. This is why without empathy there cannot be
      compassion.</p>
      <p>The teaching of karma is really fairly simple, straightforward and
      commonsensical. It says that our intentions and deeds affect ourselves and
      other people, so we should nourish good wills and do our best to make
      everyone’s life better. It is in this way the idea of karma promotes
      universal, spiritual loving kindness, and is a cornerstone of Hindu
      and Buddha dharma. Karma is not some mysterious metaphysical, supernatural
      force or power that somehow comes back to haunt you. Karma is simply what
      we do. Learning to do better is just part of growing up. And growing up is
      just life.</p>

          soul retains a person’s memory, shouldn’t the memory get passed along
          from one life to the next? Moreover, if a person does not remember
