      <p class="first" style="margin-top: 48px">The term &ldquo;karma&rdquo;
      literally means &ldquo;deeds,&rdquo; and has become a commonly used word
      even among people who are not Hindus or Buddhists. Clich&eacute;s such as
      &ldquo;You reap what you sow&rdquo; and &ldquo;What goes around comes
      around&rdquo; are often repeated to explain karma, but they capture only a
      fragment of what the idea of karma is meant to teach in the Hindu and the
      Buddhist <em>dharma</em>. To gain a more complete and deeper
      understanding of karma, we need to study it against the background of the
      Hindu history. After all, it is an idea first developed in India.</p>
      <h2>Karma, Rebirth and the Caste System</h2>
      <p>After the Aryan people migrated to the India subcontinent, they set up
      the Caste system to consolidate their rule over the indigenous people in
      the Indus Valley. The rigid and unjust system caused tremendous suffering
      among people in the lower castes. Had you been born as a member of the
      lower castes or, worse, as an untouchable, not only would you have had a
      hard life, but your children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren would
      also have been members of the same caste or outcastes with no hope of
      improving their lot. It would not be surprising that the question of
      &ldquo;Why me?&rdquo; would cross your mind at some point in time.
      Wondering why you were born as an untouchable while others were born as
      princes or princesses would fill you with anguish and fury. What would
      you do if you found yourself born into such a bondage? Would you be
      willing to just accept your fate and toil all your life for a meager
      subsistence?</p>
      <p>We can imagine the agony and wretchedness of such a life due to
      despair. There would be no hope that things would get better for you and
      your offspring. Thus, it is quite understandable that Hindus would turn to
      religion to find a way out. There is truth in the aphorism that religion
      gives people hope. One way to understand various spiritual traditions and
      religions is to see how they help their followers answer basic questions,
      address common concerns and cope with hardships in life.<sup id="fnref:1">
      <a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> By looking into how the idea
      of karma and the belief in rebirth helped people of the lower classes cope
      with the injustice and brutality of the Caste system, we can gain a deeper
      appreciation of their significance in the Indian spiritual traditions.</p>
      <p>At first glance, the doctrine of how karma affects rebirths seem to
      give the lower castes and the untouchable hope to escape the iron grip of
      the Caste system through good karma. Allegedly, by accumulating good karma
      in this life one could be reborn into a higher caste in the next life.
      Moreover, it seems to provide an explanation of why people are born into
      different castes. It is claimed that people are born into lower castes
      because of bad karma from previous lives.</p>
      <p>However, this doctrine, widely attributed to the religious teachings of
      India, is a corrupted understanding of karma and rebirth that could be
      used to sustain the unjust Caste system. The teaching of karma and rebirth
      in Hindu dharma is supposed to expose the blatant unfairness, brutality
      and cruelity of the Case system. But, instead, it is perverted by such a
      commonly repeated view to justify the status quo and add insult to injury.
      “You are born into a low caste because of your bad karma from the previous
      life. You deserve your lot in this life! It all your own faults!” So
      instead of questioning the legitimacy of the caste system and fighting
      against its injustice and cruelty, people in the lower castes were
      brainwashed into putting blame on their bad karma from their previous
      lives and accept their lot as punishments. They were told that if they
      wanted to better their next lives, then they should slave away in this
      life to accumulate good karma.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2"
      class="footnote">2</a></sup> By telling members of the lower castes to
      place their hope in the next life, the corrupted teaching weakens their
      motivation to revolt against the cruel and inhumane system. In addition,
      it masks the fact that the Caste system was what casted them into such a
      miserable lot in the first place. Also, the belief that bad people will be
      punished in the next life drills fear into people&rsquo;s hearts and
      serves as a deterrent so that they dare not rebel. This way, the ruling
      classes can minimize the likelihood of an uprising.</p>
      <p>Religions can give people hope and inspire people to strive for a
      better future, but they can also be turned into a powerful system of
      reward and punishment to control people and keep them subjugated.<sup
      id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">3</a></sup> The view that
      good karma will result in a higher rebirth and bad karma, a lower one
      should be rejected for three reasons. First, it is perverted to maintain
      the status quo. Second, the stance that the lower castes and the outcastes
      deserve their lot is detestable. Third, and more importantly, it is
      inconsistant with both Hindu and Buddha dharma.</p>
      <h2>Atman, Anatta and Rebirth</h2>
      <p>First of all, rebirth according to both Hindu and Buddha dharma is not
      the transmigration of an individual soul from body to body. The
      transmigration view presupposes a metaphysical dualism that claims that a
      person consists of a physical body and a non-physical soul.<sup
      id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote">4</a></sup> Upon death, a
      person&rsquo;s soul would leave the body. Later on, the soul would enter a
      new body and result in the rebirth of the person. This view is widepread
      and commonly held, but it is not what rebirth really is according to both
      spiritual traditions.</p>
      <p>In Hindu dharma, a person, together with every other maya<sup id="fnref:5">
      <a href="#fn:5" class="footnote">5</a></sup> in the cosmos, is an
      appearance of <em>Brahman</em>. Since we humans are appearances of
      Brahman, Brahman is what each of us truly is. Your atman, i.e., your true
      self, is Brahman.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6"
      class="footnote">6</a></sup> A person&rsquo;s birth is the beginning of
      Brahman appearing as her, a person and maya. Her death is the end of such
      an appearance. Once Brahman ceases to appear as a particular person, that
      person would cease to exist as maya. But her true self, Brahman, would
      continue to exist. Brahman may appear in the future as someone very
      similar to that person, but it is not the same person returning to live
      another life. Rather, <em>it is Brahman that is reborn</em> (that is,
      reappears).<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote">7</a></sup>
      Since Brahman is what a person truly is, in this sense it can be said
      that the person is reborn.</p>
      <p>The Buddhist view on rebirth differs from the Hindu&rsquo;s. Buddha
      dharma refrains from metaphysical speculations and avoids asserting the
      existence of Brahman. Instead, it focuses on the impermanence of the world
      and the dependent arising (co-conditioning and interacting) of karma. As a
      result, Buddha dharma counsels us not to <em>see</em> each other as
      individual beings. (This is the gist of the teaching of <em>anatta</em>.)
      Instead, we should learn to recognize the interbeing (a term coined by
      Thich Nhat Hanh) of all. Rebirth then is understood as <em>the
      continuation of karma</em>. A person’s karma is who she is and is
      constantly reverberating in the ocean of karma. Because of dependent
      arising, her karma can be emulated and carried on by others in the future.
      These future patterns of karma would be &ldquo;her&rdquo; rebirth. </p>
      <p>For people who long for a continuing existence after death, these
      proper understandings of rebirth can be a letdown. However, not clinging to
      individual existence is the key to <em>maksha</em> in Hindu dharma and
      <em>nivarna</em> in Buddha dharma. It is also worth pointing out that the
      popular saying &ldquo;Good karma leads to good rebirths&rdquo; is still
      correct under these proper understandings. In both Hindu and Buddha
      dharma, a person is reborn when her good karma inspires and gives rise to
      new manifestations of such a legacy.<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8"
      class="footnote">8</a></sup>
      What should be rejected is the view that a person with good karma will
      return in the next life as the same person and live a good life as the
      reward.</p>
      <h2>Karma Is Not About Reward and Punishment</h2>
      <p>Another reason for rejecting the popular but mistaken view that
      karma determines one&rsquo;s rebirth is that such a view is very
      tunnel-visioned in seeing everything in terms of reward and punishment. It
      turns the spiritual teaching of karma into a scrooge&rsquo;s obsession in
      calculating his spiritual, moral debts and credits, with the impure,
      self-serving motivation of avoiding punishment and getting reward. This
      distorted view leads many people to think of karma in terms of the
      worn-out saying &ldquo;What goes around comes around.&rdquo; This kind of
      thinking can suffocate one&rsquo;s spiritual growth. Instead of being
      inspired and empowered to be more prudent, considerate and caring, a
      person is consumed with constant anxiety over his individual sum of karma,
      and the fear of bad karma catching up with him. It is clear that such a
      view does not sit well with Hinduism and Buddhism. Both aim to inspire
      people to be selfless and transcend the worldly concern of reward and
      punishment. </p>
      <p>The what-goes-around-comes-around view of karma is inadequate and
      misleading> It is too individualistic, and goes against an important
      insight in the teaching of karma&mdash;one&rsquo;s intentions and deeds
      affect not only oneself but also other people. Accounting for a
      person&rsquo;s fortune or misfortune solely in terms of what he did in the
      past has at least two shortcomings. First of all, this would make it seem
      as if my karma has effects only on me. This may lead us into thinking that
      what I do affects only myself, so I can do whatever I want in life; after
      all, it is my life. Consequently, it would promote self-centeredness.
      Second, such an individualistic explanation leaves out how other
      people&rsquo;s karma affects a person, and hence is incomplete. A more
      comprehensive causal explanation of why someone were born into slavery in
      the Hindu Caste system has to take into account many things other people
      did before his birth: the deeds of the Aryan people who set up the system,
      the deeds of slave masters who continue to uphold the unjust system, the
      life of his parents, and so on.<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9"
      class="footnote">9</a></sup></p>
      <p>Some may complain that such a causal account does not address the issue
      of fairness. It does not answer the &ldquo;Why me?&rdquo; and &ldquo;Why
      not me?&rdquo; questions. It does not explain how comes I was not born as
      a prince or a prodigy.<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10"
      class="footnote">10</a></sup></p>
      <p>However, such a complaint begs the question. It presupposes that if I
      did not do anything to deserve it, then it is unfair for me to be born as
      a slave while another person was born as a prince. But this is exactly the
      wrong kind of thinking, namely, the individualistic, blame-the-victim
      mentality, the Hindu teaching of karma is meant to help us overcome.</p>
      <p>Instead, you were who you were at birth because you were your
      parents&rsquo; child, and you were born into a certain family, area,
      society and culture at a certain time in history. Your parents&rsquo;
      genes and what they and other people did before your birth affected you in
      one way or another, and contributed to the physical and mental conditions,
      what kind of family and socio-economic class you were born into. So
      whether you were born healthy, into a good family with loving parents or
      not is beyond your control and should not be seen as somehow a result of
      your own doing.</p>
      <p>We should not accept an understanding of karma that promotes the
      it&rsquo;s-all-your-own-fault mindset just to satisfy our demand of
      fairness based on the crude conception that all is fair if everyone gets
      what he deserves.</p>
      <p>Indeed, it is unfair if some are born as princes and princesses while
      others are born as slaves. A person born as a prince cannot in good
      conscience use the superficial understanding of karma to justify his being
      born as a prince and others being born as his servants and maids, thinking
      that everyone deserves his or her lot due to past karma. Rather, if he is
      spiritual, he may want to change the socio-political system into a more
      equitable one.</p>
      <p>It is also unfair that some are born with talents and others,
      disabilities. Realizing this, a spiritual person would shun using his
      advantages as a head start in life. Instead, he would commit himself to
      serve others.</p>
      <p>The questions of &ldquo;Why me?&rdquo; and &ldquo;Why not me?&rdquo;
      arise also because we see each other as individuals. When we compare
      individual lives and notice the inequality, we demand an answer of why
      some people seem to be better off than others. In Hinduism, the teaching
      of &ldquo;We are Brahman&rdquo; aims to inspire us to see spiritually that
      we are one and share one life together&mdash;in the sense that <em>we are
      willing to take other people&rsquo;s joy as our joy and their suffering as
      our suffering</em>. In this way, the seeming inequality in life dissolves
      in the ocean of love. When we all have the same life, how can life be
      unfair?</p>
      <p>Many may find this totally absurd. They would cry out loud, &ldquo;What
      are you talking about? How can we all have the same life? I don&rsquo;t
      feel what others feel.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>But not being able to or not wanting to feel what others feel is
      exactly where the difficulty lies. We cannot feel others&rsquo; feeling
      because we are more or less self-centered. Self-centeredness blinds us and
      blocks our empathy. It is only through the expansion of empathy can we
      feel what others feel, and merge our lives with their lives. This is why
      there cannot be compassion without empathy.</p>
      <p>The teaching of karma is really fairly simple, straightforward and
      commonsensical. It says that our intentions and deeds affect us and other
      people, so we should nourish good wills and do our best to make
      everyone&rsquo;s life better. It is in this way the idea of karma in
      Hinduism and Buddhism promotes universal, spiritual love, and is a key
      part of these two spiritual traditions. Karma is not some mysterious
      metaphysical, or supernatural, force or power that somehow comes back to
      haunt you. Karma is simply what we do. Learning to do better is just part
      of growing up. And growing up is just life.</p>

            the plausibility of the transmigration view. A common question is why

            soul retains a person&rsquo;s memory, shouldn&rsquo;t the memory get
            passed along from one life to the next? Moreover, if a person does not
