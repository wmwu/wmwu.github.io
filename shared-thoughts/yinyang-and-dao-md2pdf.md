*Yinyang* (陰陽，阴阳) and *dao* (*tao*, 道) are two of the most
important concepts in the Chinese culture and philosophy. They constitute the
fundamental conceptual framework that shapes the Chinese worldview.

## *Taiji* and *Yinyang* {#taiji-and-yinyang style="page-break-after: avoid"}

To understand these two concepts, we need to start with another important
concept *taiji* (*Taichi*, 太極，太极). *Yi Jing* (*I Ching*, 易經，易经), the
Book of Changes, is an ancient Chinese scripture that focuses on the study of
changes. In *Yi Jing Xici* it is stated that “*taiji* yields, or gives rise to,
two *yi* (儀，仪); two *yi* yield four *xiang* (象); four *xiang* yield eight
*gua* (卦).”^[1](#fn:1){.footnote}^

*Taiji* is the primordial reality in which no differentiation has occurred. We
can visualize it as an endless, undifferentiated space or void. As such, it is
both something and nothing. It is something because it is *that which is*. It is
nothing because before differentiation it cannot be said that there is *this*
and there is *that*.^[2](#fn:2){.footnote}^ It is the unity and oneness of
reality. It is that from which everything becomes what it is.

*Yin* and *yang* originate from *taiji*. “*Taiji* yields two *yi*.” These two
*yi* are *yin* and *yang*. When differentiation starts, contrasts will emerge as
*yin* and *yang*. *Yin* and *Yang* form a binary pair. *Yin* means "that which
is not *yang*" and *yang* means “that which is not *yin*.” As soon as there is
*yin*, there is *yang*. There cannot be *yin* without *yang*, and *yang* without
*yin*. To illustrate this, we can construe *yin* and *yang* as *this* and
*that*. *This* is “that which is not *that*”, and *that* is “that which is not
*this*.” When there is *this*, that which is not *this* would be *that*. There
is no *this* without *that*, and no *that* without *this*.

As a binary, *Yin* is symbolized using the sign “\textsf{⚋}” and *yang* with
“\textsf{⚊}”. (They can be symbolized with the Hindu-Arabic numerals as 0 and 1.
0 is non-1 and 1 is non-0.) The symbols can then be used to represent the
contrasts that we recognize as different characteristics or states of reality.
After the first differentiation, reality would be divided into two parts or two
states: one of them *yin* \textsf{⚋} (0) and the other *yang* \textsf{⚊} (1). If
each of the two are further differentiated, then there would be four parts or
four states (four *xiang*): *yin-yin* \textsf{⚏} (00), *yin-yang* \textsf{⚍} (01)
*yang-yin* \textsf{⚎} (10) and *yang-yang* \textsf{⚌} (11). If each of these four
differentiates one more time, there would be eight (eight *qua*): \textsf{☷}
(000), \textsf{☳} (001), \textsf{☵} (010), \textsf{☱} (011), \textsf{☶} (100),
\textsf{☲} (101), \textsf{☴} (110), and \textsf{☰} (111). Here we have the eight
trigrams. With three additional differentiations, we would have sixty-four
hexagrams such as \textsf{䷊} and \textsf{䷌}. This process can continue indefinitely.

\end{wrapfigure}

With this schema, the Chinese people categorize the contrasts in the cosmos as
*yin* and *yang*. Some common examples of *yinyang* pairs are day/night,
sun/moon, hot/cold, summer/winter, fire/water, and male/female. It cannot be
stressed enough that the designation of *yin* or *yang* in no way implies that
one is better than the other. It would be silly to maintain that day is better
than night or fire is superior to water. *Yin* and *yang* are just a binary pair
used to represent the contrasts that show different characteristics in the
world. *Alas*, over time, a tendency toward favoring *yang* over *yin*
germinated and sprouted out in the Chinese culture, resulting in unfounded
prejudices that foster discrimination. The prejudice against women has caused
much suffering in the history of China.^[3](#fn:3){.footnote}^

## Without *Yinyang*, No Changes {#change-as-the-rise-and-fall-of-yinyang style="page-break-after: avoid"}

The very concept of change presupposes the existence of differences. To say that
a change occurs means that a shift from *this* to *that*, or from *that* to
*this*, takes place. If *this* stays as *this*, then there would be no change.
Moreover, there cannot be a binary of *this* and *that* without a
differentiation. The essential meaning of *yinyang* is differentiation and
contrast. So we can sum up the important point so far this way: without
*yinyang*, there would be no changes. Once there is a contrast of *yin* and
*yang*, changes become possible. We can now see why *yinyang* is such a key
concept in the Book of Changes, *Yi Jing*. After the first differentiation,
reality is distinguished into *yin* (\textsf{⚋}, 0) and *yang* (\textsf{⚊}, 1). A
shift from *yin* to *yang*, or from *yang* to *yin*, would be a change. Given
more differentiations, there would be more states. A change would in general be
a shift from a given state to a different state. For instance, four seasons can
be designated as follows: spring (\textsf{⚍}, 01), summer (\textsf{⚌}, 11), autumn
(\textsf{⚎}, 10) and winter (\textsf{⚏}, 00). The change of season from spring to
summer can then be represented as a change from *yin-yang* (\textsf{⚍}, 01) to
*yang-yang* (\textsf{⚌}, 11). Such a change is characterized as the waxing, or
strengthening, of *yang* and the corresponding waning, or weakening, of *yin*.
Since *yang* is also associated with warmth, the rise of *yang* fits well with
the observation that it gets warmer from spring to summer. This approach can be
generalized to characterize all changes as the rise and fall of *yin* and
*yang*.

## *Yinyang* and Harmony {#dynamic-harmony style="page-break-after: avoid"}

The Chinese worldview shaped by *Yi Jing* sees reality as dynamic and not
static. Changes are accepted as the way reality is and understood as the
interplay between *yin* and *yang*. As a binary, *yin* and *yang* coexist and
must accompany each other. Without *yin*, there is no *yang*, and without
*yang*, there is no *yin*. When *yang* is getting stronger, there would be a
corresponding weakening of *yin*, and vice versa. To use the change of day and
night as an example, around midnight, *yin* is at its highest point and *yang*
its lowest. Henceforward, *yang* would be rising and *yin* falling. At dawn,
*yin* and *yang* are at an equilibrium. *Yang* would continue to strengthen and
reach its peak around noon, but then start to weaken. At dusk, the two would
reach another equilibrium. This waxing and waning of *yin* and *yang* throughout
twenty four hours of the day is regarded as an example of a *dynamic* balance of
*yin* and *yang*.

Now imagine that for some unknown causes and conditions, daylight persists for
twenty four hours. There is no dusk, night and dawn, and the whole day is just
like noon. The change of day and night is disrupted. Using the language of *Yi
Jing*, we would *describe* this bizarre phenomenon as *yang* staying at its
fullest strength for twenty-four hours.^[4](#fn:4){.footnote}^ Such a disruption
is regarded as a disharmony, a breakdown of the *dynamic* balance of *yin* and
*yang*.

Likewise, floods and droughts are examples of disharmony. In contrast, the
normal change of day and night and the change of seasons are taken to be
examples of harmony, viewed as the *dynamic* balance of *yin* and *yang*. The
focus of *Yi Jing* and the Chinese worldview is to study and understand how
changes occur and evolve so as to maintain harmony and avoid disharmony. This is
why *dao* is another important concept in the Chinese worldview.

## *Dao* (*Tao*) {#dao-tao style="page-break-after: avoid"}

\begin{wrapfigure}{R}{0.35\textwidth}

  \end{minipage}
\end{wrapfigure}

In a weekday when we go from home to school or work,
a change of location takes place. To go from one place to another you would have
to follow a road, and the route you take is how the change from being home to
being at school or work takes place.^[5](#fn:5){.footnote}^ The Chinese
character “dao” literally means "the road" or "the path." The term “dao” is then
generalized to mean *the way of changes*. Since changes are characterized and
interpreted in terms of the interplay between *yin* and *yang*, *dao* is thus
the principle that formulates the waxing and waning of *yin* and *yang*. The
focus of the Chinese worldview is to achieve and maintain harmony. This is why
studying *dao* becomes the central intellectual pursuit in the Chinese culture.
The goal is to learn about *dao* so that changes can be understood, managed, and
guided to achieve and sustain harmony not only in human society but also between
humans and nature.

Regrettably this fundamental meaning of *dao* got obscured over time in the
history of China. Many schools of thoughts advocated various interpretations
that mystify *dao* and dress *dao* in baffling cloaks. Some even turn *dao* into
a supernatural force that influences or controls nature and people’s life. The
prevalence of divination and fortune-telling in the Chinese culture is rather
unfortunate. It is a symptom resulting from a lack of in-depth understanding of
*yinyang* and *dao*. The teaching of *Yi Jing*, instead of being properly
studied and understood to promote harmony, has been turned into systems of
divination for personal gains and ascendancy.^[6](#fn:6){.footnote}^

## The Characteristics of the Chinese Worldview {#the-characteristics-of-the-chinese-worldview style="page-break-after: avoid"}

Grounded on the framework of *yin* and *yang*, the Chinese worldview
seeks to achieve and maintain harmony by means of knowing *dao*. As a
result, it has five characteristics that make it stand out as a major
worldview.

### The Emphasis on Harmony {#the-emphasis-on-harmony style="page-break-after: avoid"}

First of all, the main concern of the Chinese worldview is harmony. Harmony is
regarded as good while disharmony, bad. Notice that the contrast is between good
and bad, not good and evil. This distinction is important. Even though
disharmony is viewed as bad, it is understood and accepted as something that
will occur from time to time. So the goal is to minimize or shorten disharmony,
not to eliminate it. This is different from other worldviews that center on good
and evil, and seek to eliminate evil. Moreover, since disharmony is understood
as the dynamic imbalance between *yin* and *yang*, it is not deemed as evil. In
contrast to many western traditions, the Chinese worldview does not postulate
some supernatural beings or higher power to represent good or
evil.^[7](#fn:7){.footnote}^

### The Progressive Outlook {#the-progressive-outlook style="page-break-after: avoid"}

Second, changes in reality and in life are accepted as inevitable, and not
regarded as bad or undesirable. Reality is perceived as dynamic, and not static.
It would be misguided and futile to try to stop changes. Instead of keeping the
status quo, one should study *dao* and find ways to guide changes to achieve
harmony. This provides a philosophical footing for the progressive outlook.

### The Middle Way {#the-middle-way style="page-break-after: avoid"}

Third, virtues and vices are understood in terms of the dynamic balance or
imbalance between *yin* and *yang*.^[8](#fn:8){.footnote}^ The dominance of one
over the other for a prolonged period of time, or on too many occasions, would
be regarded as bad. For instance, a person would be impetuous if she rushes to
act most of the time. On the other hand, it is also less than ideal if a person
is overly cautious and indecisive. A person with the trait of being prudent, but
capable of acting quickly when necessary would be praised as virtuous.

### Cooperation Over Competition {#Cooperation-Over-Competition style="page-break-after: avoid"}

The fourth characteristic of the Chinese worldview is to promote cooperation and
shun conflict and competition. It embraces the way of *ren* and harmony
(*rendao*, 仁道) and rejects the way of domination and bullying (*badao*, 霸道).
Applied to gender equality, this means that the talk of the war between men and
women would be found distasteful in the Chinese worldview. The long-term
domination of men over women, or women over men, would be bad. Instead, the
harmony in a household is to be achieved by the mutual respect and cooperation
between the couple.

### The Focus on the Present Life {#the-focus-on-the-present-life style="page-break-after: avoid"}

The last distinctive feature of the Chinese worldview is its focus on living a
good life in the present life. The concern is not on the afterlife such as
Heaven or rebirth. It does not assume the existence of an
afterlife^[9](#fn:9){.footnote}^ and regard the present life as somehow
secondary to the next life. Rather, it accepts that this life is finite and
encourages the outlook of living the present life to the fullest.

These five characteristics set the Chinese worldview apart from others. They
result from the conceptual framework of *yinyang* and *dao*, laid down and set
forth in *Yi Jing*. Many schools of thoughts in the Chinese tradition aim to
know *dao* so as to comprehend changes and promote harmony. They differ mainly
on how *dao* can be known and how harmony can be achieved and sustained. The two
most prominent schools, Confucianism (*rujia*, 儒家) and Daoism (*daojia*, 道家), share these outlooks and ideals, but advocate different ways of learning
about *dao* and achieving harmony. The proper understanding of *yinyang* and
*dao* gives us a head start in studying their teachings.

    If *yin* and *yang* are supposed to be equal, then what accounts for China
    being a male-dominant society for thousands of years? The causes lie more on
    China being an agrarian country for thousands of years and its needs to
    defend itself against nomadic tribes than on philosophical or religious
    grounds. It is telling that the Chinese character for man or the male, *nan*
    (男), is composed of two Chinese characters: *tian* (田) and *li*
    (力). Together, these two characters literally means “manpower or labor in

    It would be a mistake to say that the *cause* of such a disruption is *yang*

    generalize, there can be more than one way to change, and which *dao* is the

    The contrast and the mutual dependency between *yin* and *yang* are

    *yang*, good cannot exist without evil. However, such a contention is a
    misapplication of *yinyang*. It would be an error to say that good is *yin*
    and evil is *yang*, or good is *yang* and evil is *yin*. More seriously, such
