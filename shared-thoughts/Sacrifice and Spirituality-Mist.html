      <h1>Sacrifice and Spirituality</h1>
      <p style="margin-top: 30px"><span class="dropcap">W</span>hen a religion shifts
      its focus from presenting offerings to a deity and asking for blessings and
      protection in return, to sacrificing oneself for the well-being of the others,
      it goes through a critical phase of deep spiritual awakening. The concern is no
      longer about what one can gain by performing the sacrificial ritual, but about
      the spirituality manifested in sacrificing oneself for others out of love.</p>
      
      <p>Such a transformation occurred in the history of Hinduism. Hinduism arose
      from the confrontation between, and the synthesis of, the Aryan culture and the
      indigenous Indus Valley civilization. The Aryans who eventually came to dominate
      and rule the Indian subcontinent were nomads, much like the ancient Jewish
      people. Their nomadic way of life forged their strong tribal identities and
      religions. They had their own tribal deities, whom they appeal to for protection
      and prosperity. It is quite understandable that nomadic tribes in antiquity, in
      coping with their anxiety over security and survival, turned to the supernatural
      and entrusted their fate in the hand of their deities. Given such a
      socio-economic and cultural background, it is no wonder that sacrificial
      ceremonies, through which the connection and relationship between the tribe and
      its deities was sustained, became the focal point in tribal life.</p>
      
      <p>However, after settling down in the subcontinent and adopting the more
      agrarian way of life, the Aryans went through religious identity crises, in ways
      very similar to what the ancient Israelites experienced after settling down in
      the Canaan, though with different outcomes. With the new way of life, the Aryans
      wondered whether they should continue the ritual tradition that their ancestors
      followed on the vast grassy plain of central Eurasia. Along with questioning the
      necessity and the practicality of performing ritual ceremonies, they dived
      deeper into the rationale of such undertakings. They increasingly felt uneasy
      about, and were no longer satisfied with, the traditional understanding of
      sacrificial rituals, which they meticulously performed to gain favors and
      blessings from their deities. Throughout the Upanishads period they strived to
      find a deeper meaning behind the sacrificial ritual. Eventually it was dawned on
      them that the meaning lies in the sacrificed. They came to see that the idea and
      practice of presenting offerings in rituals in order to gain what they want are
      self-centered. Accordingly, the concerns about whether the ritual ceremony is
      carried out correctly, whether the people involved are purified and pious, are
      all self-serving. This recognition led them to see that the sacredness and
      nobility of sacrifice lie in the sacrificed, which symbolizes the willingness to
      suffer and even die for others’ well-being. The willingness illustrates one’s
      unselfishness and love for others, which become the hallmark of this newfound
      spirituality. This deeper understanding of sacrifice became the cornerstone of
      Hindu spirituality and elevated Hinduism from a regional and tribal religion to
      a major world religion. Spiritual transformation is now understood as the
      transformation from self-centeredness to selflessness.</p>
      
      <p>The shift of attention from the sacrificial ritual to the sacrificed is also
      a shift from the supernatural to the spiritual. Once our focus moves from
      concerns over improving our well-being to the willingness to sacrifice ourselves
      for others’ well-being, it is no longer necessary to believe in the supernatural
      as a source or power that can guarantee the fulfillment of our desires—including
      the desire for immortality. This enables religious followers to deepen their
      understanding of the divine beyond the common anthropomorphic conception of gods
      and goddesses. The divine, instead of being pictured as supernatural sentient
      beings, is now understood as the highest spirituality, love and compassion.</p>
      
      <p>Parallel to the change toward a deeper understanding of the divine, there is
      also a shift in spirituality from piety to love. The traditional idea of obeying
      and appeasing a powerful deity so that one can live long and prosper is no
      longer the focal point of being religious. Empathy, love and compassion are now
      the new center of spirituality. In the Hindu tradition, various ways of
      cultivating love and compassion would come to be known as yoga. Yoga is the
      religious and spiritual activities that a devout Hindu would practice daily so
      as to become a loving and spiritual person over time.</p>
      
      <p>Understanding such a shift of spiritual focus will also help us appreciate
      the Buddhist spirituality. The central concern of Buddhism is to lessen and
      eliminate sentient beings’ discontent and suffering. It is very telling that
      such a concern does not lead to the worship of deities as a means to safeguard
      and promote the followers’ well-being. The worship of deities is never
      emphasized as essential in Buddhism. Instead, the concern leads to the teaching
      of Bodhisattvas—the teaching of forgoing one’s attainment of nirvana to help
      others reach theirs. Bodhisattvas vow to devote themselves for eons to bear and
      ease others’ suffering, and thus become the embodiment of unlimited
      compassion.</p>
