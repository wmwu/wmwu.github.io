# *Wu Wei*: Living Without Prejudice

*Daojia* ([道家]{.tc}) is another Chinese school of thoughts that rivals Confucian philosophy and has had great impact on the Chinese and Asian culture.^[1](#refn:1){.footnote}^ The two most important Daoist philosophers are *Laozi* ([老子]{.tc}) and *Zhuangzi* ([莊子]{.tc}). The Daoist school of thoughts is sometimes referred to as *Lao Zhuang zhexue* ([老莊哲學]{.tc}), the philosophy of *Laozi* and *Zhuangzi*, so as to distinguish it from *daojiao* ([道教]{.tc}, religious Daoism).

## Against the Cultivation of Virtues {#against-the-cultivation-of-virtues style="page-break-after: avoid"}

The Confucian way of knowing *dao* is through *de* ([德]{.tc}，virtues). Once a person becomes a *junzi* ([君子]{.tc}, a person of *ren*), he or she would learn about *dao*. This is why the cultivation of virtues is so essential in Confucianism. Strikingly, Daoism rejects the cultivation of virtues.
