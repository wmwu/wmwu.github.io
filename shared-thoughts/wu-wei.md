# *Wu Wei*: Living Without Prejudice

*Daojia* ([道家]{.tc}) is another Chinese school of thoughts that rivals Confucian philosophy and has had great impact on the Chinese and the Asian culture. The two most important Daoist philosophers are *Laozi* ([老子]{.tc}) and *Zhuangzi* ([莊子]{.tc}). The Daoist school of thoughts is sometimes referred to as *Lao Zhuang zhexue* ([老莊哲學]{.tc}), the philosophy of *Laozi* and *Zhuangzi*, so as to distinguish it from *daojiao* ([道教]{.tc}, religious Daoism).^[1](#refn:1){.footnote}^

## Against the Cultivation of Virtues {#against-the-cultivation-of-virtues style="page-break-after: avoid"}

The Confucian way of knowing *dao* is through *de* ([德]{.tc}, virtues). Once a person becomes a *junzi* ([君子]{.tc}, a person of *ren*), he or she would learn about *dao*. This is why the cultivation of virtues is so essential in Confucianism. Strikingly, Daoism is against the cultivation of virtues and regards it as the root of disharmony.

The first reason Daoism is against the cultivation of virtues is that *li* ([禮]{.tc}, the norms of decorum and civility) leads to moral degeneration and hypocrisy. When a society tries to mold its people by means of *li* through rewards and punishments, this tends to lead people to pretend to be virtuous to gain rewards and avoid punishments.

## Preference and Prejudice {#Preference-and-Prejudice style="page-break-after: avoid"}

The more serious charge Daoism levels against Confucianism is that the cultivation of virtues perpetuates certain values that reflect a society's preferences and prejudices. Truthful to the philosophical framework of *Yi Jing* ([易經]{.tc}，[易经]{.sc}, the Book of Changes), Daoism reminds us that differences in the world are merely contrasts. They are presented by *yin* or *yang*. We need to be careful not to favor *yin* over *yang*, or *yang* over *yin*. Otherwise, preference would lead to prejudice. *Laozi*'s insight is stated in *Dao De Jing*: "When the world knows what beauty is, whence comes what it dislikes; When it knows what is good, whence comes what is not good. In this way the positive and the negative yield each other; the difficult and the easy form each other; the long and the short contrast each other;..."^[2](#refn:2){.footnote}^ When people like what is beautiful, such a preference is already a prejudice against that which is not beautiful in the sense that they like the latter less than the former. When a child is adored for being beautiful, how would that affect other kids noticing that they are not getting the same amount of attention and praises? Moreover, can we blame the child showered with adoration for vanity? Doesn't the problem with designer babies and eugenics stem from our preferences for the healthier, more attractive, more intelligent and more athletic people?

Daoism sees *li* as a set of values derived from people's preferences and the cultivation of virtues as a way to institutionalize and perpetuate them. This would lead to systematic discrimination and become the root of disharmony. *Laozi* cautioned us "not to prefer people with abilities and virtues so that people would not compete with each other; not to value hard-to-obtain goods so that people would not steal; not to see things that are desirable so that people's hearts would not be stirred."^[3](#refn:3){.footnote}^ As an alternative, *Laozi* advocates "the sage's way of governing" that "humbles people's hearts, fills their bellies, weakens their wills, and strengthens their bones." *Laozi* envisages that such a way of governing would "make people, as a norm, have no clue what is desirable, and hence have no desires. Keep those who know what is desirable from daring to act upon their desires. When people act without the will to act, then there would be no disorders."^[4](#refn:4){.footnote}^

## Wu Wei {#wu-wei style="page-break-after: avoid"}

Daoism disagrees with Confucianism that one can know *dao* by becoming virtuous. On the contrary, Daoism holds that *dao* precedes virtue---one becomes virtuous by knowing *dao*. But how does one know *dao*?

The Daoist way of knowing *dao* is by becoming desireless (*wuyu*, [無欲]{.tc}).
