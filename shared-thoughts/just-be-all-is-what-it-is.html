      <p class="first"><em>Daojia</em> (<span class="tc">道家</span>) is another Chinese
        school of thought that rivals Confucian philosophy and has had a great
        impact on the Chinese and the Asian culture. The two most important
        Daoist philosophers are Laozi (<span class="tc">老子</span>) and
        Zhuangzi (<span class="tc">莊子</span>, <span class="sc">庄子</span>).
        The Daoist school of thought is sometimes referred to as <em>Lao Zhuang
        zhexue</em> (<span class="tc">老莊哲學</span>, <span
        class="sc">老庄哲学</span>), the philosophy of Laozi and Zhuangzi, so as
        to distinguish it from <em>Daojiao</em> (<span class="tc">道教</span>,
        religious Daoism).<sup><a onclick="scrollToFootnote(this)" id="refn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup></p>
      <h2 style="page-break-after: avoid"
        id="against-the-cultivation-of-virtue">Against the Cultivation of
        Virtue</h2>
      <p>The Confucian way of knowing <em>dao</em> is through <em>de</em>
        (<span class="tc">德</span>, virtue). Once a person becomes a
        <em>junzi</em> (<span class="tc">君子</span>, a person of <em>ren</em>),
        they would learn about <em>dao</em>. This is why the cultivation of
        virtue is paramount in Confucianism. Strikingly, Daoism is against the
        cultivation of virtue and regards it as the root of disharmony.</p>
      <h3 style="page-break-after: avoid" id="Virtue-and-Degeneration">Virtue
        and Degeneration</h3>
      <p>The first reason Daoism is against the cultivation of virtue is that
        <em>li</em> (<span class="tc">禮</span>, <span class="sc">礼</span>, the
        norms of decorum and civility) leads to hypocrisy and moral
        degeneration. When society tries to mold its people into <em>junzi</em>
        by means of <em>li</em>, usually through rewards and punishments, people
        would pretend to be virtuous to gain rewards and avoid punishments.<sup><a onclick="scrollToFootnote(this)" id="refn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup></p>
      <p>In <em>Dao De Jing</em> (<span class="tc">《道德經》</span>, <span
        class="sc">《道德经》</span>), Laozi clearly states why he is against
        the cultivation of virtue:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>The higher <em>de</em> has merit because it has no concern with
        virtue; the lesser <em>de</em> has no merit because it cares about not
        losing virtue. The higher <em>de</em> does not try to do good and does
        not need to be driven by good intentions; the lesser <em>de</em> tries
        to do good and is driven by good intentions. The higher <em>ren</em>
        (<span class="tc">仁</span>, benevolence) tries to do good and does not need to be driven by
        good intentions; the higher <em>yi</em> (<span class="tc">義</span>,
        <span class="sc">义</span>, righteousness) tries to do good out of good
        intentions. The higher <em>li</em> does good out of the expectation of
        customs that compel people to behave. Accordingly, <em>de</em> takes
        center stage after <em>dao</em> is lost; <em>ren</em> is in play after
        <em>de</em> is lost; <em>yi</em> is emphasized after <em>ren</em> is
        lost; <em>li</em> becomes the game in town after <em>yi</em> is lost.
        The focus on <em>li</em> reflects the lack of <em>zhong</em> (<span class="tc">忠</span>, faithfulness) and <em>xin</em> (<span class="tc">信</span>, trustworthiness), and is the beginning of disorder.”<sup><a onclick="scrollToFootnote(this)" id="refn:3" class="footnote">3</a></sup></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Laozi’s most profound insight is that if all things follow
        <em>dao</em>, they would flourish and become the paragons of what they
        are supposed to be. They would by nature thrive and reach their own kinds
        of excellence in each of their own ways without the slightest idea that
        they need to be virtuosos. They are virtuosos simply as a result of the
        ways they flourish. They do not need moral concepts and
        rules to tell them how they should behave.</p>
        <p>A world where people care primarily about legality and civility would
        already have been less just and righteous. When minority groups have to
        fight in court against atrocious gerrymandering cases, how fair and just
        is such a democracy? When people have to struggle for their fair share,
        what happens to kindness and generosity? Isn’t the call for compassion
        toward disadvantaged and less fortunate people a reflection of the lack
        thereof? And why would there be a need for compassion to begin with?
        Would people in a virtuous and caring society end up being homeless?
        Haven’t we already lost our way if we need virtue and morality to guide
        and regulate our lives?</p>
      <h3 style="page-break-after: avoid"
        id="preference-and-prejudice">Preference and Prejudice</h3>
      <p>A more serious charge Daoism levels against the cultivation of virtue
        is that it perpetuates certain values that reflect a society’s
        preferences and prejudices. Daoism sees <em>li</em> as a set of values
        derived from societal and cultural preferences. It views the cultivation
        of virtue with suspicion as a way to institutionalize and perpetuate
        sanctioned values that would lead to systematic discrimination and
        become the root of disharmony.</p>
      <p>Truthful to the philosophical framework of <em>Yi Jing</em> (<span
        class="tc">《易經》</span>, <span class="sc">《易经》</span>, <em>the
        Book of Changes</em>), Daoism reminds us that differences in the world
        are merely contrasts. They are represented as <em>yin</em> and
        <em>yang</em>. <em>Yin</em> is not better than <em>yang</em> and
        <em>yang</em> is not better than <em>yin</em>.<sup><a onclick="scrollToFootnote(this)" id="refn:4" class="footnote">4</a></sup> We
        need to be careful not to favor <em>yin</em> over <em>yang</em>, or
        <em>yang</em> over <em>yin</em>. Otherwise, preference would lead to
        prejudice. Laozi’s insight is stated in <em>Dao De Jing</em>:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>When the world knows what beauty is, whence comes what it dislikes;
        When it knows what is good, whence comes what is not good. In this way
        the presence or absence of something yield each other; the difficult and
        the easy correlate with each other; the long and the short contrast each
        other; the high and the low distinguish each other; different sounds
        accord each other; the anterior and the posterior put each other in
        order<sup><a onclick="scrollToFootnote(this)" id="refn:5" class="footnote">5</a></sup>.<sup><a onclick="scrollToFootnote(this)" id="refn:6" class="footnote">6</a></sup></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>When people like what is beautiful, such a preference is already a
        prejudice against that which is not beautiful in the sense that they
        like the latter less than the former. When a child is adored for being
        beautiful, how would that affect other kids when they notice that they
        are not getting the same amount of attention and praises? Moreover, can
        we blame the child showered with adoration for vanity? Doesn’t the
        problem with designer babies and eugenics stem from our preference for
        the healthier, better-looking, more intelligent and more athletic
        people?</p>
      <p>Why do we prefer people with good health, attractive physical
        appearance, talents and abilities? Isn’t it because we realize that they
        have advantages and are more likely to succeed in the game of getting
        ahead in life? Don’t they tend to be adored and treated favorably? If
        this is the honest truth, can we blame parents for wanting their kids to
        have these desirable traits? It is small wonder that our world would
        face the problem of eugenics and designer babies.<sup><a onclick="scrollToFootnote(this)" id="refn:7" class="footnote">7</a></sup></p>
      <h2 style="page-break-after: avoid" id="wuwei"><em>Wuwei</em> (<span
        class="tc" style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 600;">無為</span>, <span class="sc" style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 600;">无为</span>, No Action)</h2>
      <p>Laozi’s remedy for the ills rooted in preference and prejudice is
        <em>wuwei</em>. And the key to <em>wuwei</em> is <em>wuyu</em> (<span
        class="tc">無欲</span>, <span class="sc">无欲</span>, desireless).
        Desire and preference are two sides of the same coin: to desire
        something is to wish for what one prefers. Desires would incline people
        to act with the intention to pursue what they want. Hence to act without
        intention one needs to become desireless.</p>
      <p>A common objection to the tenet of being desireless is that to desire
        is human. It is simply impossible for humans not to desire. It is
        natural to want to eat when hungry and want to drink when thirsty. There
        is nothing wrong with such desires.</p>
      <p>But of course Laozi would have no quarrel with such natural drives
        and behaviors. On the contrary, he would include them as part of
        <em>wuwei</em>. To live a life of <em>wuwei</em> is to simply be—to live
        without preference and act without intention. It is to act in a natural
        and spontaneous way: to eat when hungry, to drink when thirsty, to sleep
        when drowsy and so on. In contrast to <em>wuwei</em>, actions with
        intention are actions driven by human-contrived ideas and preference. To
        crave delicate cuisines even when one is full, to hoard gold and jewels
        to show off one’s wealth, or to grasp power to advance one’s status and
        fame would be the opposite of <em>wuwei</em>.</p>
      <p>Laozi points out that the best way to understand <em>wuwei</em> and
        <em>wuyu</em> is to follow the course of nature:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>Hence the paragons of virtue conduct affairs in accordance with
        <em>wuwei</em> and teach without using words;<sup><a onclick="scrollToFootnote(this)" id="refn:8" class="footnote">8</a></sup> let
        all things flourish without interruption and produce without claiming
        possession. Act without expecting certain consequences.<sup><a onclick="scrollToFootnote(this)" id="refn:9" class="footnote">9</a></sup></a>
        When things are accomplished, do not dwell on and claim credit for them.
        Since there is no attachment, there would be no sense of deprivation and
        loss.<sup><a onclick="scrollToFootnote(this)" id="refn:10" class="footnote">10</a></sup></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>He cautions us “not to prefer people with abilities and virtues so
        that people would not engage in one-upmanship with each other; not to
        value hard-to-obtain goods so that people would not steal; not to see
        things as desirable so that people’s hearts would not be stirred.”<sup><a onclick="scrollToFootnote(this)" id="refn:11" class="footnote">11</a></sup> As an alternative, he advocates
        “the paragon’s rule” that “humbles people’s hearts, fills their bellies,
        weakens their wills, and strengthens their bones.” Laozi envisages that
        a way of life under such rule would “make people, as a norm, have no
        clue what is desirable, and hence have no desires. Keep those who know
        what is desirable from daring to act upon their desires. When people act
        without the will to act, then there would be no disorders.”<sup><a onclick="scrollToFootnote(this)" id="refn:12" class="footnote">12</a></sup></p>
        <h2 style="page-break-after: avoid"
        id="transcending-virtue-and-morality">Transcending Virtue and
        Morality</h2>
        <p>It is now clear why Daoism is against the cultivation of virtue.
        Virtues and moral values are socially and culturally sanctioned
        preferences and prejudices. Their cultivation is the root of disorders and
        unrest. Both Laozi and Zhuangzi see moral concepts and rules as a human
        contrivance that is at odds with the way of nature.<sup><a onclick="scrollToFootnote(this)" id="refn:13" class="footnote">13</a></sup>
        Once humans acquire moral concepts and rules along with the
        consciousness of pride/guilt, honor/shame and praise/condemnation, we
        can’t help but anxiously assess our own moral worthiness and judge each
        other without end.<sup><a onclick="scrollToFootnote(this)" id="refn:14" class="footnote">14</a></sup> We are entrapped in the cage of
        moral judgment and have forgotten how to flourish by simply following
        <em>dao</em>.</p>
        <p>For Laozi, to truly live a life in accordance with <em>dao</em> we
        need to transcend virtue and morality and live amorally. We have lived
        under morality for so long that it has become unfathomable for most of
        us that a life beyond morality is possible. To begin with, imagine that
        humans have no concepts of morality and are so pure and innocent as not
        to need them.<sup><a onclick="scrollToFootnote(this)" id="refn:15" class="footnote">15</a></sup> Alternatively, imagine Heaven where
        all the faithful and spiritual rejoice. Would they still worry about
        committing sins? Would there still be moral judgment? Would moral rules
        still apply in Heaven?</p>
        <p>If one finds it hard to imagine the Garden of Eden or Heaven, then
        simply observe how living things interact with one another to form the
        web of life in nature. A mother bear would watch over her cubs without
        needing to be compelled by a moral sense to carry out a parent’s
        duty. Lions would kill and eat gazelles without feeling guilty of being
        savage and immoral.<sup><a onclick="scrollToFootnote(this)" id="refn:16" class="footnote">16</a></sup> It is only through the lens of
        morality that we see natural animal behavior as morally praiseworthy or
        condemnable. But nature on its own is amoral, without preference and
        prejudice<sup><a onclick="scrollToFootnote(this)" id="refn:17" class="footnote">17</a></sup> and has no use for morality.</p>
        <p>Daoism shuns human contrivance and advocates that humans follow the
        way of nature and live in harmony with nature. In this sense, it is one
        of the oldest environmentalism. At a time when we are struggling with
        global unrest and terrorism, the likelihood of nuclear annihilation
        and the collapse of ecosystems due to climate change, a renaissance of
        the Daoist teachings can provide us insights on the way forward.</p>
