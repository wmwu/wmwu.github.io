      <p style="margin-top: 48px"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he term &ldquo;karma&rdquo; literally
      means &ldquo;deeds,&rdquo; and has become a commonly used word even among people who are not
      Hindus or Buddhists. Clich&eacute;s such as &ldquo;You reap what you sow&rdquo; and &ldquo;What goes
      around comes around&rdquo; are often cited to explain karma, but they capture only a
      fragment of what the idea of karma is meant to teach in the two spiritual
      traditions. To gain a more complete and deeper understanding of karma, we need
      to study it against the background of the Hindu history. After all, it is an
      idea first developed in Hinduism.</p>
      
      <p>After the Aryan people entered the India subcontinent, they set up the
      Caste system to consolidate their rule over the indigenous people in the
      Indus Valley. The rigid and unjust system caused tremendous suffering among
      people in the lower castes. Had you been born as a member of the lower
      castes, or worse, as an untouchable, not only would you have had a hard
      life, but your children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren would also
      have been members of the same caste or outcastes with no hope to improve
      their lot. What would you have done if you had found yourself born into such
      a bondage? Would you have been willing to just accept your fate and toil all
      your life for a meager subsistence?</p>
      
      <p>We can imagine the agony and wretchedness of such a life due to despair.
      There would be no hope that things would get better for you and your
      offspring. Thus, it is quite understandable that Hindus would turn to
      religion to find a way out. There is truth in the aphorism that religion
      gives people hope. One way to understand various spiritual traditions and
      religions is to see how they help their followers answer basic questions,
      address common concerns and cope with hardships in life.<a class="endnote" name="Endnote01t"
      id="Endnote01t" href="#Endnote01n">1</a></p>
      
      <p>By looking into how the idea of karma and the belief in rebirth helped
      people of the lower classes cope with the injustice and brutality of the
      caste system, we can gain a deeper appreciation of their significance in the
      Indian spiritual traditions. Prima facie they seem to give Hindus hope to
      escape the iron grip of the caste system through good karma, which would
      allegedly lead to a rebirth into a higher caste. The doctrine of how karma
      affects rebirths also seems to provide an explanation of why people are born
      into different castes. It is claimed that people are born into lower castes
      because of bad karma from previous lives. In additional to providing an
      explanation, the belief that bad people will be punished in the next life
      can also serve as a deterrent by drilling fear into people&rsquo;s hearts so that
      they dare not transgress.</p>
      
      <p>However, karma, understood this way, would become an idea that sustains the
      unjust caste system. By telling members of lower castes to place their hope in
      the next life, it weakens their motivation to challenge and eliminate the
      inhumane and cruel system. It also camouflages the fact that the caste system
      was what caused people in the lower castes to yearn for the escape from its iron
      grip in the first place.</p>
      
      <p>The fishy stench of such an account gets stronger when it attempts to explain
      away the inequality in terms of karma from the previous life. If you were an
      untouchable under the caste system, it would not be surprising that the question
      of &ldquo;Why me?&rdquo; would cross your mind at some time or another. Why would you be
      born as an untouchable while others were born as princes or princesses? Instead
      of acknowledging that the case system is blatantly unfair, such a
      pseudo-explanation amounts to an in-your-face shout &ldquo;It all your own faults! You
      deserve it!&rdquo; So instead of questioning the legitimacy of the caste system and
      fighting against its injustice and cruelty, people in the lower castes were
      taught to put blame on their bad karma from their previous lives and accept
      their lot as punishments. If they wanted to better their next lives, then they
      should slave away their lives to accumulate good karma.<a class="endnote" name="Endnote02t"
      id="Endnote02t" href="#Endnote02n">2</a></p>
      
      <p>This shows how the teachings of karma and rebirth can be hijacked and misused
      to solidify the power and privileges of the upper classes. Beliefs in karma and
      rebirth can be twisted to convince members of the lower castes to stay put in
      their stations of life and place their hope in the next life. This way, the
      ruling classes can minimize the likelihood of an uprising. Religions can give
      people hope and inspire people to strive for a better future, but they can also
      be turned into a powerful system of reward and punishment to control people and
      keep them subjugated.<a class="endnote" name="Endnote03t" id="Endnote03t"
      href="#Endnote03n">3</a></p>
      
      <p>The view that good karma will result in a higher rebirth and bad karma, a
      lower rebirth should be rejected not only for the ploy to maintain the
      status quo and the detestable stance that the lower castes and the outcastes
      deserve their lot, but more importantly for its incoherence with the overall
      Hindu teachings.</p>
      
      <p>First of all, rebirth according to both Hinduism and Buddhism is not the
      transmigration of an individual soul from body to body. The transmigration view
      presupposes a metaphysical dualism that claims that a person consists of a
      physical body and a non-physical soul.<a class="endnote" name="Endnote04t" id="Endnote04t"
      href="#Endnote04n">4</a> Upon death, a person&rsquo;s soul would leave the
      body. Later on, the soul would enter a new body and result in the rebirth of the
      person. But this is not what rebirth is according to Hinduism and Buddhism.</p>
      
      <p>In Hinduism, a person, together with every other maya<a class="endnote" name="Endnote05t"
      id="Endnote05t" href="#Endnote05n">5</a> in the cosmos, is an
      appearance of Brahman (the Hindu term for the divine). Since we humans are
      appearances of Brahman, Brahman is what each of us truly is. Your atman&mdash;your
      true self&mdash;is Brahman.<a class="endnote" name="Endnote06t" id="Endnote06t"
      href="#Endnote06n">6</a> A person&rsquo;s birth is the beginning of Brahman
      appearing as he, and his death is the end of such an appearance. Once Brahman
      ceases to appear as a particular person, that person would cease to exist.
      Brahman may appear in the future as someone very similar to that person, but it
      is not the same person returning to live another life. Rather, it is Brahman
      that is reborn (that is, reappears).<a class="endnote" name="Endnote07t" id="Endnote07t"
      href="#Endnote07n">7</a> Since Brahman is what the person truly is,
      in this sense it can be said that the person is reborn.</p>
      
      <p>The Buddhist view on rebirth differs from the Hindu&rsquo;s. Buddhism refrains from
      metaphysical speculations and avoids asserting the existence of Brahman.
      Instead, it focuses on the impermanence of the world and the dependent arising
      (or interacting) of karma. As a result, Buddhism counsels us not to see each
      other as individual beings. Instead, we should learn to recognize the interbeing
      (a term coined by Thich Nhat Hanh) of all. Rebirth then is understood as the
      continuation of karma. Since we are what we do, a person&rsquo;s karma (legacy) can be
      emulated and carried on by others in the future. These future patterns of karma
      would be &ldquo;his&rdquo; rebirth. </p> <p>It is worth pointing out that the popular saying
      &ldquo;Good karma leads to good rebirths&rdquo; is still correct and should be understood
      properly under both Indian traditions. In both Hinduism and Buddhism, a person
      is reborn when his good karma inspires and gives rise to new manifestations of
      such a legacy.<a class="endnote" name="Endnote08t" id="Endnote08t"
      href="#Endnote08n">8</a> What should be rejected is the view that a
      person with good karma will return in the next life as the same person and live
      a good life as the reward.</p>
      
      <p>The second reason for rejecting the popular but mistaken view that karma
      determines one&rsquo;s rebirth is that such a view is very tunnel-visioned in seeing
      everything in terms of reward and punishment. It turns the spiritual teaching of
      karma into a scrooge&rsquo;s obsession in calculating his spiritual, moral debts and
      credits, with the impure, self-serving motivation of avoiding punishment and
      getting reward. This distorted view leads many people to think of karma in terms
      of the worn-out saying &ldquo;What goes around comes around.&rdquo; This kind of thinking
      can suffocate one&rsquo;s spiritual growth. Instead of being empowered to be prudent,
      considerate and caring, a person is consumed with constant anxiety over his
      individual sum of karma, and the fear of bad karma catching up with him. It is
      clear that such a view does not sit well with Hinduism and Buddhism. Both aim to
      inspire people to be selfless and transcend the worldly concern of reward and
      punishment. </p>
      
      <p>The third reason why the what-goes-around-comes-around view
      of karma is inadequate and misleading is that it is too individualistic, and
      goes against an important insight in the teaching of karma&mdash;one&rsquo;s intentions and
      deeds affect not only oneself but also other people. Accounting for a person&rsquo;s
      fortune or misfortune solely in terms of what he did in the past has at least
      two shortcomings. First of all, this would make it seem as if my karma has
      effects only on me. This may lead us into thinking that what I do affects only
      myself, so I can do whatever I want in life; after all, it is my life.
      Consequently, it would promote self-centeredness. Second, such an
      individualistic explanation leaves out how other people&rsquo;s karma affects a
      person, and hence is incomplete. A more comprehensive causal explanation of why
      someone were born into slavery in the Hindu Caste system has to take into
      account many things other people did before his birth: the deeds of the Aryan
      people who set up the system, the deeds of slave masters who continue to uphold
      the unjust system, the life of his parents, and so on.<a class="endnote" name="Endnote09t"
      id="Endnote09t" href="#Endnote09n">9</a></p>
      
      <p>Some may complain that such a causal account does not address the issue of
      fairness. It does not answer the &ldquo;Why me?&rdquo; and &ldquo;Why not me?&rdquo; questions. It does
      not explain how comes I was not born as a prince or a prodigy.<a class="endnote"
      name="Endnote10t" id="Endnote10t" href="#Endnote10n">10</a></p>
      
      <p>However, such a complaint begs the question. It presupposes that if I did not
      do anything to deserve it, then it is unfair for me to be born as a slave while
      another person was born as a prince. But this is exactly the wrong kind of
      thinking, namely, the individualistic, blame-the-victim mentality, the Hindu
      teaching of karma is meant to help us overcome.</p>
      
      <p>Instead, you were who you were at birth because you were your parents&rsquo; child,
      and you were born into a certain family, area, society and culture at a certain
      time in history. Your parents&rsquo; genes and what they and other people did before
      your birth affected you in one way or another, and contributed to the physical
      and mental conditions, what kind of family and socio-economic class you were
      born into. So whether you were born healthy, into a good family with loving
      parents or not is beyond your control and should not be seen as somehow a result
      of your own doing.</p>
      
      <p>We should not accept an understanding of karma that promotes the
      it&rsquo;s-all-your-own-fault mindset just to satisfy our demand of fairness based on
      the crude conception that all is fair if everyone gets what he deserves.</p>
      
      <p>Indeed, it is unfair if some are born as princes and princesses while others
      are born as slaves. A person born as a prince cannot in good conscience use the
      superficial understanding of karma to justify his being born as a prince and
      others being born as his servants and maids, thinking that everyone deserves his
      or her lot due to past karma. Rather, if he is spiritual, he may want to change
      the socio-political system into a more equitable one.</p>
      
      <p>It is also unfair that some are born with talents and others, disabilities.
      Realizing this, a spiritual person would shun using his advantages as a head
      start in life. Instead, he would commit himself to serve others.</p>
      
      <p>The questions of &ldquo;Why me?&rdquo; and &ldquo;Why not me?&rdquo; arise also because we see each
      other as individuals. When we compare individual lives and notice the
      inequality, we demand an answer of why some people seem to be better off than
      others. In Hinduism, the teaching of &ldquo;We are Brahman&rdquo; aims to inspire us to see
      spiritually that we are one and share one life together&mdash;in the sense that we are
      willing to take other people&rsquo;s joy as our joy and their suffering as our
      suffering. In this way, the seeming inequality in life dissolves in the ocean of
      love. When we all have the same life, how can life be unfair?</p>
      
      <p>Many may find this totally absurd. They would cry out loud, &ldquo;What are you
      talking about? How can we all have the same life? I don&rsquo;t feel what others
      feel.&rdquo;</p>
      
      <p>But not being able to or not wanting to feel what others feel is exactly
      where the difficulty lies. We cannot feel others&rsquo; feeling because we are more or
      less self-centered. Self-centeredness blinds us and blocks our empathy. It is
      only through the expansion of empathy can we feel what others feel, and merge
      our lives with their lives. This is why there cannot be compassion without
      empathy.</p>
      
      <p>The teaching of karma is really fairly simple, straightforward and
      commonsensical. It says that our intentions and deeds affect us and other
      people, so we should nourish good wills and do our best to make everyone&rsquo;s life
      better. It is in this way the idea of karma in Hinduism and Buddhism promotes
      universal, spiritual love, and is a key part of these two spiritual traditions.
      Karma is not some mysterious metaphysical, or supernatural, force or power that
      somehow comes back to haunt you. Karma is simply what we do. Learning to do
      better is just part of growing up. And growing up is just life.</p>

      then the doctine would say that your soul is God. This clearly is at odds with
      the tramsmigration view of rebirth, which requires each of us to have an
      individual and distinctive soul.</p>
      
      <p class="footnote"><a class="endnote" name="Endnote07n" id="Endnote07n"
      href="#Endnote07t">7</a>The problem of personal identity has been a
      very challenging issue for western philosophy and religious traditions. It also
      undermines the plausibility of the transmigration view. A common question is why
      most, if not all, people do not remember their previous lives. If the soul
      retains a person&rsquo;s memory, shouldn&rsquo;t the memory get passed along from one life
      to the next? Moreover, if a person does not remember what he did in the previous
      life, in what sense can we say that he is being rewarded or punished in the
      present life?</p>
      
      <p class="footnote">Once rebirth is understood correctly in Hinduism as the
      reappearance of Brahman, then it would become clear that these questions are
      pseudo-questions stemming from the error in the transmigration view.</p>
