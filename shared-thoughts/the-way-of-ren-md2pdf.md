##

The teachings of the Confucian school of thoughts, *rujia*
([儒家]{.tc}), can be summed up as *rendao* ([仁道]{.tc}), the way of
*ren*. Kongzi ([孔子]{.tc}, Confucius) once recapitulated his core
teachings as: "Set sight on *dao*; be grounded on *de* (virtues); be
guided by *ren*; immerse oneself in fine art."^[1](#fn:1){.footnote}^
*Rendao* is the Confucian way of achieving harmony in human society.
Both *rujia* and *daojia* ([道家]{.tc}, the Daoist school of thoughts)
subscribe to the Chinese worldview shaped by *Yi Jing*
([易經，]{.tc}[易经]{.sc}), *the Book of Changes*. The central tenet of
*Yi Jing* is that knowing *dao* ([道]{.tc}) is the key to achieve and
maintain harmony. According to Kongzi, the way to know *dao* is through
becoming a virtuous person.

## The Confucian Way of Knowing *Dao*

Truthful to the heritage of *Yi Jing*, Kongzi grasps learning as a
process of change---a process of personal transformation. As one learns
more and more about medicine, one would become a medical doctor or
healer. To become a chef is to learn the art of cooking, and by becoming
a loving person one would know love. Likewise, one would know *dao* by
becoming a virtuous person---a *junzi* ([君子]{.tc}). Kongzi has been
revered as the Paragon Teacher. This insight into learning has become
the bedrock of education for more than two thousand years in the Chinese
tradition and has greatly influenced many Asian cultures.

The *Analects* (*Lunyu*, [論語，]{.tc}[论语]{.sc}) starts with Kongzi's
comment about learning: "Isn't it a joy to learn and put what's learned
into practice? Isn't it a great pleasure to have a friend visiting from
afar? Isn't it being a *junzi* to harbor no resentment toward those who
do not know us?"^[2](#fn:2){.footnote}^ It may seem that Kongzi strayed
off the topic of learning in such a short remark and talked about
unrelated matters of a friend's visit and harboring no resentment. But
once we come to know Kongzi's view on personal transformation by means
of the cultivation of virtues, we would see that Kongzi stayed on the
topic and the whole comment is about learning. Cultivation and
transformation is a gradual process that takes daily practice. In
day-to-day contacts, we may not notice and discern the small changes
that is occurring daily. However, friends who haven't seen each other
for several years would, upon reunion, notice the transformation. It
would indeed be a joy to see each other's progress in personal
development toward becoming a *junzi*. Kongzi's remark on harboring no
resentment toward people who do not know us is about the motivation of
personal cultivation. Since a *junzi*'s personal growth is not driven by
the pursuit of money and status, he or she would naturally take no
offense when others fail to pay their respects.

As more and more people become virtuous, they would know *dao* and work
together to build a harmonious society so that humans can flourish and
live a good life. To this end, Confucianism seeks to educate and
transform people into virtuous members of society through the
cultivation of *de* ([德]{.tc}), virtues.

## The Cultivation of Virtues

The cultivation of *de* centers on three virtues: *ren* ([仁]{.tc}),
*zhong* ([忠]{.tc}) and *shu* ([恕]{.tc}). It is hard to find exact
words in English as translations of these three terms. To gain a more
complete understanding of them, we will go over each Chinese character
to bring out its full meaning.

### *Ren*

\begin{wrapfigure}{R}{0.3\textwidth}

  \begin{minipage}{5cm}

  \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth, height=!]{ren.png}
  \caption{The Chinese \newline Character \it Ren}
  \end{minipage}
\end{wrapfigure}

In Kongzi's teachings *ren* is the most important virtue to cultivate
people for a harmonious society. It is the virtue that serves as the
bedrock for all the other virtues. It is commonly translated as kindness
or benevolence. But this comes up short of capturing its original
meaning.

The Chinese character '[仁]{.tc}' is composed of two characters:
'[人]{.tc}' and '[二]{.tc}'. The character '[人]{.tc}' means "human" or
"people". The character '[二]{.tc}' is the Chinese numeral for "two".
Together these two characters mean "two people". The original meaning of
'[仁]{.tc}' reveals tellingly how the character came to be used to
represent the virtue that governs how two people should treat each
other. The term is used to capture Kongzi's teaching of
reciprocity---the proper ways of how two people treat each other. As
ethics is seen in the Chinese culture as a matter of how people live
with others and treat each other, *ren* became the virtue that
encompasses all the other virtues. In the *Analects*, Kongzi typically
teaches *ren* with examples of how one should treat others under various
circumstances. These examples serve to elucidate the proper ways of
managing inter-personal relationships. When people treat each other
right with civility, harmony can be advanced in households and society.

A person who has developed the virtue of *ren* is called a *junzi* and
is a paragon to emulate and learn from. A *junzi* would always treat
others with respect and civility, and conduct him- or herself properly
as a loyal and dedicated government official or public servant, a loving
and devoted husband or wife, a firm and caring parent, a filial son or
daughter, and a trustworthy friend.

Kongzi's blueprint for achieving harmony in human society is quite
commonsensical and down to earth. The more *junzi* there are in a
society the more harmonious it would become. One of Kongzi's beloved
disciples Zengzi ([曾子]{.tc}) once summed up Kongzi's teachings in
terms of two other virtues: *zhong* ([忠]{.tc}) and *shu*
([恕]{.tc}).^[3](#fn:3){.footnote}^

### *Zhong*

\begin{wrapfigure}{R}{0.3\textwidth}
  \raggedleft
  \begin{minipage}{5cm}
  \captionsetup{singlelinecheck = false}
  \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth, height=!]{zhong.png}
  \caption{The Chinese \newline Character \it Zhong}
  \end{minipage}
\end{wrapfigure}

*Zhong* ([忠]{.tc}) can be translated into a wide variety of words such
as truthfulness, sincerity, dedication, loyalty, impartiality and
unbiasedness. Again, we can gain a deeper understanding of its original
meaning by deciphering the Chinese character. The character '[忠]{.tc}'
is made up of two characters: '[中]{.tc}' and '[心]{.tc}'. The character
'[中]{.tc}' has two meanings: (1) "inside", and (2) "middle" or
"center". The character '[心]{.tc}' means "heart". Accordingly, the
first literal meaning of *zhong* is "from the inside of one's heart". If
everything we say and do comes from our hearts, then we would be
truthful with ourselves and sincere toward others. For Confucianism, the
cultivation of virtue starts with being honest with oneself. To improve
oneself and become a *junzi* over time, one needs to know
oneself---especially one's shortcomings. By recognizing and
acknowledging one's deficiencies, one could then begin to work on
correcting them and become a better person. Psychologically, this is a
hard step to take, for facing our shortcomings does not make us feel
good about ourselves. However, it is the first hurdle we need to cross
if we want to improve ourselves. This is why daily self-reflection is
greatly emphasized in Confucianism. To cultivate *zhong*, we need to
engage in self-reflection to make sure what we say and do comes from our
hearts. Zengzi was beloved by Kongzi because he practiced daily
reflection on three acts to cultivate himself.^[4](#fn:4){.footnote}^

Furthermore, it is only when a person is truthful with him- or herself
can he or she be trusted by others. A trustworthy person would of course
be faithful and loyal, and always do his or her best for others. This is
why *zhong* also means being loyal, trustworthy, and dedicated.

The second literal meaning of *zhong* is "heart in the middle". To put
one's heart in the middle means to have an "unbiased heart"---to be
fair, just and impartial. The virtue of *zhong* is paramount in
combating prejudice, discrimination and bigotry.

### *Shu*

\begin{wrapfigure}{R}{0.3\textwidth}
  \raggedleft
  \begin{minipage}{5cm}
  \captionsetup{singlelinecheck = false}
  \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth, height=!]{shu.png}
  \caption{The Chinese \newline Character \it Shu}
  \end{minipage}
\end{wrapfigure}

*Shu* ([恕]{.tc}) is often translated as empathy, compassion and forgivingness (the
willingness to forgive). The character '[恕]{.tc}' is formed by
combining two characters '[如]{.tc}' and '[心]{.tc}' together. As we saw
earlier, '[心]{.tc}' means "heart". The character '[如]{.tc}' means
"similar". So '[恕]{.tc}' literally means "a similar heart". To have the
virtue of *shu* is to have a heart similar to the heart of the person
whom one cares about. This means, first of all, to be sensitive and
considerate, to have empathy, to put oneself in another person's shoes.
Moreover, a person who has empathy would more likely be compassionate
and forgiving.

The virtue of *zhong* motivates us to be truthful, dedicated and strive
to be our best. However, we are only human and, despite our best efforts
to be good, can still make mistakes in life. When we err or transgress,
we need others to forgive us. By reciprocity, when others come up short
or misbehave, we need to find room in our hearts to forgive them. It is
never easy, but without *shu*, it would be hard to mend relationships
and sustain harmony. When Zigong ([子貢，]{.tc}[子贡]{.sc}) asked Kongzi
for a motto to serve as a life-long guidance, Kongzi picked *shu*. This
indicates how important Kongzi thinks *shu* is. Kongzi was among the
first great sages to articulate the Golden Rule. He stated the rule as
"what you do not want done to yourself, do not do to the
others."^[5](#fn:5){.footnote}^ It is clear that to follow the Golden
Rule is to practice the virtue of *shu*. Once we understand how *zhong*
and *shu* are supposed to complement each other, we come to appreciate
why both virtues are essential in the way of *ren*.

## The Institution of *Li*

\begin{wrapfigure}{R}{0.3\textwidth}
  \raggedleft
  \begin{minipage}{5cm}
  \captionsetup{singlelinecheck = false}
  \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth, height=!]{li.png}
  \caption{The Chinese \newline Character \it Li}
  \end{minipage}
\end{wrapfigure}

*Li* ([禮，]{.tc}[礼]{.sc}) means the norms of decorum and civility. The
cultivation of virtues and the transformation of society is to be
carried out through *li* so as to promote harmony. Kongzi's disciple
Youzi once said that "the most valuable objective of implementing *li*
is harmony."^[6](#fn:6){.footnote}^ The approach is to set up and
promote rules of conduct and etiquettes by means of institutions and
customs. It is a gradual, long-termed process to cultivate respect and
civility among people in daily activities. Those with power and status
should especially be self-reflective and diligent in setting good
examples for others to follow. Once the proper ways of conducting
oneself becomes habitual, they would be internalized and become the
second nature. In this way a person would gradually become a *junzi*
over time.

Kongzi, unlike Mengzi ([孟子]{.tc}) and Xunzi ([荀子]{.tc}) after him, does not
presuppose that human nature is good or evil. He acknowledges that people are
born alike but with differences. But he stresses that people can become better
through self- and social-cultivation.^[7](#fn:7){.footnote}^ It is Kongzi's
humanism not to deem someone or something as evil by nature. His position is not
a scientific one based on research. Rather, it is a humanistic one in rejecting
the cruelty in regarding certain people as born evil. How can we hold a newborn
baby and say that this one is a born killer? Kongzi’s concern here is not about
whether people are born evil, or born good but corrupted by the environment. His
focus is on our obligation to do our best to raise and guide children once they
are born into this world. To give up on a child would be inhumane. Kongzi's view
is in accordance with the Chinese worldview that good is understood as dynamic
balance, and bad, dynamic imbalance. Just as *yin* or *yang* by itself is
neither good nor bad, nothing is intrinsically good or bad. Kongzi holds that
human nature is malleable and can be refined. His teaching philosophy is that we
need to do our best to teach all, regardless of people's innate likenesses and
differences. Through *li* Kongzi seeks to mold people into civilized members of
society to maintain harmony.

Mutual respect and reciprocity serve as lubricant to lessen frictions in
human interaction and thus are essential in fostering harmony in human
society. Each one of us would like others to treat us right. To earn and
be worthy of respect from others, we need to first conduct ourselves in
proper manners. This is why *li* plays a central role in Confucianism
and is always meant to be practiced with reciprocity. As Kongzi
emphasized, when we demand a son to be filial, we should also expect his
father to be loving and kind. Likewise, it would be unreasonable to ask for a
younger brother to be respectful toward an older brother without
requiring the latter to be friendly to the former.

How we should act reciprocally toward each other becomes our
responsibilities to ourselves and to others. The emphasis on the
responsibilities that come with inter-personal relationships can
counterbalance extreme individualism, restore family values and promote
social harmony. A person who deserts his family can never get away with
the lame excuse "It is my life," and we would do well not to forget the
saying "No man is an island."

The internalization of *li* at the personal level and its
institutionalization at the societal level would take decades to
cultivate. Even after we succeed in such a monumental undertaking, we
would still need to sustain it from generation to generation. For
Confucianism, a civil and humane society is like a rose garden and we
need to be constant gardeners.

## The Renaissance of Confucianism

Confucianism not only became the mainstream philosophy in China but also
greatly impacted the cultures of many Asian countries such as Korea,
Japan and Singapore. In recent decades, it has enjoyed a renaissance in
many Asian countries and gained popularity globally. Confucianism, given
its championing of harmony, can serve as a beacon of peace in the age of
globalization when the increased interactions among nations and peoples
lead to ongoing challenges to peace and harmony. Kongzi deeply believes
that harmony in human society can be achieved when we learn to treat
each other right.

The basic tenet of Confucianism that harmony can be achieved when people
learn to treat each other right may seem so obvious as to border on
banality. But its truth and practicality have been borne out throughout
human history. It is not difficult to see that much of violence and
suffering in the world throughout history results from the craving for
power to dominate and exploit others deemed inferior. Having seen so
much killing and turmoil during the Period of Spring and Autumn, Kongzi
loathed and despised *badao* ([霸道]{.tc}, the way of domination and
bullying), and championed *rendao* as a remedy for human brutality and
cruelty. The way of *ren* is his way to peace and harmony, and is even
more relevant today than during the Period of Spring and Autumn and the Era of
Warring States. Even though the basic idea of *rendao* is easy to grasp,
its implementation demands a long-term dedication and broad-scale
institutionalization. Kongzi had no illusion that human society could
ever be perfect. Still, he truly believed that it could be made more
harmonious with ongoing diligence, and urged us to do our best. In a
society of *ren*, there would be less bigotry, violence, greed and
obsession with power, but more civility, justice, generosity and
compassion.
