Please refer to it throughout      the semester to remind yourself of what is expected of you and how to      learn the subject well. The best general strategy is to read the materials      thoroughly, attend class, take good notes and complete assignments on      time. To have satisfactory performance in this class, you need to spend      around 9 hours (3 hours in class, 6 hours outside of class) per week on      this course.</p>    <h2>The Course</h2>    <p>PHIL 18 is an introductory course on Eastern Religions. It aims to help      students gain a good understanding of major Eastern religions and broaden      their worldviews. We will study Hinduism, Buddhism, Yin Yang, Confucianism      and Daoism. We will learn how the theological, mythological, ritual,      ethical, social and experiential dimensions of religion intertwine with      each other to form different worldviews and ways of life. Students will      also learn how to compare and evaluate various religious teachings and see      how they may affect one’s life.</p>    <table border="0">      <tbody valign="top">        <tr>          <td width="25%"><strong>Recommended Preparation</strong></td>          <td>Reading Level 5, English Level 4<br>          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td width="25%"><strong>Transfer Status</strong></td>          <td>UC 3B, CSU C2</td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td width="25%"><strong>Course Format</strong></td>          <td>Lecture and Discussion</td>        </tr>        <tr valign="top">          <td width="25%"><strong>Objectives/SLO</strong></td>          <td>Upon successful completion of this course, the student will be            able to:            <ol type="A">              <li>Recognize and distinguish between various world views of the                major Eastern religions.</li>              <li>Analyze and evaluate complex elements of religious phenomena.</li>              <li>Compare, appraise and evaluate the interrelationships between                particular cultures and religious expressions.</li>              <li>Assess and value diversity of Eastern religions.</li>              <li>Analyze and explain how ideas and practice from various                Eastern religions address important questions in life, and                assess their applicability to the human condition.</li>            </ol>          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>    <h2>Textbook</h2>    <p>Hagen, S.

You should bring them to class every time. Be sure to follow      the proper protocols when using these devices in class.</p>    <p>You need to ask permission in advance to take photos or record lectures.      Please follow the proper policies and etiquette.</p>    <p>To read materials posted on Canvas and to complete online assignments,      you will need to have online access at least 1–2 hours daily.</p>    <p>Utilize the resources listed in Student Support on Canvas. You can ask <a        href="http://www.butte.edu/currentstudents/help_on_campus/help_academic/student_tech_support/index.html">        Student Technical Support</a> for assistance if you run into      difficulties. It is recommended that if needed, you take mini courses to      improve your computer skills.</p>    <p>It is your responsibility to make sure your computer or device works      properly and has a reliable Internet connection. It is also a good      practice to have a backup plan to avoid missing the deadline due to      computer or Internet problems. <strong>Computer/device glitches or loss        of Internet connection will not be accepted as excuses for making up        assignments.</strong></p>    <h2>Assignments and Assessments</h2>    <h3>Reading Assignments</h3>    <p>Philosophical texts can be hard to read and difficult to understand. It      is quite common that one needs to read the text several times to fully      grasp its main points. To help yourself gain a better understanding of a      topic and become better prepared to participate in discussions and      classroom activities, it is paramount that you read the assigned materials      before the class on the date they are due.</p>    <ul>      <li>Read a chapter or an article as soon as you can after it is assigned        or recommended.</li>      <li>Outline what you read, take notes and jot down questions.</li>      <li>Do online search to learn more about new terms and philosophical        views.</li>      <li>Reread the chapter or the article at least one more time after the        lecture and class discussion to make sure you understand the finer        points. Revise and update your notes, and use them for writing        assignments.</li>      <li>Your reading comprehension will be evaluated via outlines and essay        questions on Canvas. <span style="font-weight: bold;">There is no          make-up for missed online submissions. No late submission,          resubmission or paper copy will be accepted.</span> If you miss an        assignment, you are encouraged to make up the lost points through        extra-credit.</li>    </ul>    <h3>Writing Assignments</h3>    <p>The amount of writing will exceed the 1,500-word requirement. The types      of writing include outlines of reading materials, essay questions and      forum discussions. All the writings are to be submitted on Canvas and are      graded on both form and content. <strong>There is no make-up, and no late        submission, resubmission or paper copy will be accepted.</strong></p>    <h4>Reading Outlines</h4>    <p>To assess your reading comprehension, you will be asked to outline      reading materials and post them on Canvas. This is one way you can learn      from each other and contribute to the quality and learning success of the      class.</p>    <h4>Essay Questions</h4>    <p>Essay questions are used to assess your comprehension and philosophical      thinking.</p>    <h4>Canvas Discussions</h4>    <p>We will use Canvas Discussions to foster open and in-depth discussions of      philosophical and religious issues. It’s a great way to apply critical      thinking, share viewpoints and learn from one another.</p>    <h3>Tests</h3>    <p>There will be three in-class tests: one on Hinduism, one on Buddhism and      one on the Chinese Worldview. You should use the reading outlines as study      guides to study for the tests. The test format includes True-False and      Multiple Choice. Each test is worth 100-150 points. <strong>Students who        miss a test with legitimate reasons can make it up for full or partial        credit.</strong></p>    <h2>Extra-credit</h2>    <h3>Extra-credit Assignments or Activities</h3>    <p>Extra-credit assignments or activities will be announced both in class      and on Canvas. They are optional, but you can earn extra-credit points if      you choose to do the assignment or participate in the activity.</p>    <h3>Extra-credit for Class Attendance</h3>    <p>Please take notice that attendance is not part of your grade, but you can      earn extra-credit points by keeping your absences to a minimum. It is      understandable that sometimes students can’t help but miss a class due to      illness or other reasons. So don’t force yourself to come to the class      when you are sick. Both excused and unexcused absences count toward the      number of absences. You can earn up to 40 points with good attendance.</p>    <table align="center" width="400px">      <tbody>        <tr>          <th height="50px" width="250px">Number of Absences<br>          </th>          <th height="50px" width="150px">Extra-credit</th>        </tr>        <tr align="center">          <td>0</td>          <td>40 points</td>        </tr>        <tr align="center">          <td>1<br>          </td>          <td>30 points</td>        </tr>        <tr align="center">          <td>2<br>          </td>          <td>20 points</td>        </tr>        <tr align="center">          <td>3<br>          </td>          <td>10 points<br>          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>    <h2>Grading</h2>    <p>It is important that we study for self-improvement and self-fulfillment,      and not just for grades. Your grade is to help you gauge what you have      learned in a course. By letting go of the anxiety about the grade, you      will find studying a subject matter much more enjoyable. As a result, you      are more likely to spend time learning the material and earn a good grade.      Only a hard-earned grade that truly reflects what you have learned can      forge self-confidence.</p>    <p>Your final grade will be determined by the percentage of the total points      you earn:</p>    <table align="center" width="300px">      <tbody>        <tr>          <th height="50px" width="150px">Percentage</th>          <th height="50px" width="150px">Grade</th>        </tr>        <tr align="center">          <td>90-100%</td>          <td>A</td>        </tr>        <tr align="center">          <td>80-89%</td>          <td>B</td>        </tr>        <tr align="center">          <td>70-79%</td>          <td>C</td>        </tr>        <tr align="center">          <td>60-69%</td>          <td>D</td>        </tr>        <tr align="center">          <td>below 60%</td>          <td>F</td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>    <p>The scale may be lowered, but will not be raised. You can monitor your      progress and grade percentage on Canvas.</p>    <h2>Cheating and Plagiarism</h2>    <p>Students who cheat or commit plagiarism will receive an F grade for the      assignment or for the course, depending on the seriousness of the offense.      Furthermore, they will be subject to disciplinary action. (Cf. Policy 3.21      Student Rights and Conduct) See also <a href="Academic%20Honesty%20Syllabus%20Attachment%20updated%20SP%2014.pdf.pdf"        target="_blank">Butte
        College Academic Honesty and Accommodations</a> for more details.      Remember, your integrity is far more precious than your grade.</p>    <h2>Open, Safe and Respectful Learning Environment</h2>    <p>This is <strong><em>our</em></strong> class and it is important that we      work together to establish an open, safe and respectful learning      environment. We pledge to respect all people regardless of sexuality,      gender identity, ethnicity and religious backgrounds.</p>    <p>The most important guideline to remember is the Golden Rule—Do not do to      the others what you do not want done to yourself. As you are respectful to      your teacher and classmates, they will treat you in the same way. Please      comply with the following etiquette:</p>    <ul>      <li>Always conduct yourself in an appropriate and respectable manner.</li>      <li>Attend to personal needs before coming to class.</li>      <li>Come to class on time and avoid leaving early or in the middle of a        session.</li>      <li>Respect other people even if you disagree with their views.</li>      <li>Wait for your turn to ask questions or express your viewpoints; do not        chitchat in the classroom.</li>      <li>No food, drink or chewing gum.</li>    </ul>    <h2>Tips for Success</h2>    <p>To be successful in the class and earn the grade you desire, you need to      manage your time wisely and put in your effort.</p>    <ul>      <li>Try your best not to miss classes.</li>      <li>Read the reading assignment and give the subject some thought before        the discussion in class and online.</li>      <li>Review lecture notes as soon as possible after class.</li>      <li>Ask questions if something is unclear to you.</li>      <li>Reflect upon the issues or questions as often as possible.</li>      <li>Draft your answers to essay questions and revise them before        submitting them.</li>      <li>Don’t wait until the last minute to complete online assignments.</li>    </ul>    <h2>Getting Help</h2>    <p>The best way to get help is to ask questions in class. People shy away      from asking questions because they are afraid of appearing stupid. It is      very likely that if you do not understand something, there is someone else      in the class who is suffering from an identical lack of understanding. You      will be doing your classmates a service by asking questions.</p>    <p>If something is unclear to you or you are having difficulty learning the      material, please feel free to come to see me during my office hours. If      you cannot meet with me during the regular hours, I will be glad to      schedule an appointment. Do not wait until it is too late.</p>    <p>The Center for Academic Success (CAS) provides academic support services      to Butte College students.

A student with a        disability who will be requesting a modification, accommodation, or        access to an auxiliary aid is required and responsible for identifying        himself/herself to the instructor and, if desired, to the Disabled        Student Programs and Services (DSPS) office. Students who consult or        request assistance from DSPS regarding specific modifications,        accommodations or use of auxiliary aids will be required to meet        timelines and procedural requirements established by the DSPS office.</li>      <li>If a student believes that he or she may need an accommodation for a        disability, please make an appointment to see me during my office hours        or initiate contact with the Office of Disabled Student Programs and        Services.</li>    </ul>    <h3>Alternate Media Statement:</h3>    <ul>      <li>Students with a print disability—a visual limitation or reading        difficulty that limits access to traditional print materials—may request        printed materials in alternate media. Examples of alternate media        formats include electronic format (e.g., text on CD), Braille, tactile        graphics, audiotape, and large print. Students can make alternate media        requests through the Office of Disabled Student Programs and Services.</li>    </ul>    <h2>Revision of Syllabus</h2>    <p>The syllabus is subject to revision as needed throughout the semester.</p>    <p>&nbsp; </p>    <p align="center">&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>  </body></html>
